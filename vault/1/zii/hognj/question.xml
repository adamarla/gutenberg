doublet is considered a success, then find
the probability distribution of successes.

\textbf{Getting a doublet}
The figure below shows the two dice after 
being thrown. If you can see only one die, 
then what is the \underline\text{probability you got a doublet}?

Think of it like this. You roll the two dice. 
But you see the number on Dice I before 
you see the number on Dice II. 

Dice I will have some number (1-6) on it. 

But to get a doublet, Dice II must also have 
the same number.

Which means the probability of getting a 
doublet is $=p = \frac{1}{6}$

\textbf{Probability of getting 2 doublets}
Shown below is \underline\text{one way} of getting two 
doublets in 4 rounds of throwing. But in which 
of the two figures  has the probability of 
getting two doublets been written correctly?

    <reason>%text
The probability of getting doublets in 
\underline\text{exactly rounds \#2 and \#4} is 
\[\qquad \quad p^2\cdot q^2 \text{ where } q = (1-p)  \]

\underline\text{But we want two doublets total} - not 
just in rounds 2 and 4. Which means that 
we are ok with getting the doublets in 
rounds (1,2) or (1,3) or (1,4) etc.

Hence, the \underline\text{total probability} would be 
\[ \qquad \quad ^4C_2\cdot p^2\cdot q^2 \]

\textbf{Probabilities of getting R doublets $(R\leq 4)$}
Based on what we learned from Step 2, is 
the \underline\text{following distribution table correct}? 
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline 
\text{\# of doublets} &amp; \text{Probability} \\
\hline 
0 &amp; \frac{625}{1296} \\
\hline 
1 &amp; \frac{125}{324} \\
\hline 
2 &amp; \frac{25}{216} \\
\hline 
3 &amp; \frac{5}{324} \\
\hline 
4 &amp; \frac{1}{1296} \\
\hline 
\end{tabular} </tex>
    <reason>%text
In Step 2, we learned how to find the 
\underline\text{probability of getting 2 doublets}. 

But the \underline\text{probability of getting R doublets}
$(R\leq 4)$ is simply 

\[ \qquad \qquad P(R) = ^4C_R \cdot p^R \cdot q^{4-R} \] 

Note that $q = 1-p = \frac{5}{6}$ in the above equation. 

And hence, the \underline\text{probability distribution} 
will be as follows

%

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\text{\# of doublets} &amp; \text{Prob. Expr.} &amp; \text{Probability} \\
\hline 
0 &amp; ^4C_0\cdot p^0\cdot q^4 &amp; \frac{625}{1296} \\
\hline 
1 &amp; ^4C_1 \cdot p^1\cdot q^3 &amp; \frac{125}{324} \\
\hline 
2 &amp; ^4C_2 \cdot p^2 \cdot q^2 &amp; \frac{25}{216} \\
\hline 
3 &amp; ^4C_3\cdot p^3\cdot q^1 &amp; \frac{5}{324} \\
\hline 
4 &amp; ^4C_4 \cdot p^4\cdot q^0 &amp; \frac{1}{1296} \\
\hline
