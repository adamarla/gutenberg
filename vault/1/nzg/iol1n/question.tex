\question[3]   If the difference between the simple interest earned over one year
and the compound interest - payed semi-annually - over the same year is \texteuro 180,
then what is the initial investment amount. The annualized interest rate in both cases is 10\%

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	If $I_1$ be the interest earned from \emph{compounding} in one year, $P_0$ the 
	initial investment amount and $P_1$ the amount at the end of the first year, then
	
	\begin{align}
		I_1 &= P_1 - P_0 \\ 
		    &= P_0\cdot\left[ 1+\dfrac{R}{N}\right]^N - P_0 \\
		    &= P_0\cdot\left[ (1+\dfrac{R}{N})^N - 1 \right]
	\end{align}
	where $N$ = number of compounding periods = 2
	
	Over the same period, the \emph{simple} interest earned - $I_2$ - is equal to
	\begin{align}
		I_2 &= P_0\cdot R\cdot T(=1)
    \end{align}
    
    And therefore, if $I_1-I_2 = \text{\texteuro 180}$, then 
    \begin{align}
    	\text{\texteuro 180} &= P_0\cdot\left[ (1+\dfrac{0.1}{2})^2 - 1 - 0.1\right] \\
    	                     &= 0.0025\cdot P_0 \\
    	\Rightarrow P_0 &= \text{\texteuro 72,000}
    \end{align}
\end{solution}
