\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  If $A_0$ be the initial amount, $A_1$ the amount at the end of the first year
  and $A_2$ the amount at the end of the second year, then the interest earned 
  in the second year $(= I_2)$ would be
  
  \begin{align}
  	I_2 &= A_2 - A_1 \\ 
  	    &= A_0\cdot(1+R)^2 - A_0\cdot(1+R) \\
  	    &= \text{\texteuro 8,000}\cdot\left[ (1+0.1)^2-(1+0.1)\right] \\
  	    &= \text{\texteuro 880}
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
