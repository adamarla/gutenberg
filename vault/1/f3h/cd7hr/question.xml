Two messengers $M_A$ and $M_B$ started running 
towards each other from points $A$ and $B$, 
$98$ km apart. They met $7$ hours later. On the 
way back, $M_A$ ran $1$km/h slower than before,
while $M_B$ ran $1$km/h faster than before, thus
returning two hours earlier than $M_A$. What 
were the original speeds of $M_A$ and $M_B$?

    <context>%text
If the messengers run at speeds $S_A$ and $S_B$
towards each other and meet after $7$ hours,
is the following correct?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>(S_A+S_B)\times 7=98</tex>
    <tex>(S_A-S_B)\times 7=98</tex>
    <reason>%text
Since the messengers are running towards
each other, we know that between them they 
covered the $98$ km stretch in $7$ hours.
%
\begin{align}
  &amp;\therefore
    \overbrace{S_A(km/h)\times 7(h)}^\text{distance $M_A$}+
    \overbrace{S_B(km/h)\times 7(h)}^\text{distance $M_B$}=98 \\
  &amp;\implies (S_A+S_B)\times 7=98 \\
  &amp;\implies S_A+S_B=14
\end{align}</reason>

On their return paths $M_A$, running $1$ km/h 
slower than before, takes two hours longer to
get back than $M_B$ who is running $1$ km/h 
faster than before. Does the following 
equation capture this condition?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>\dfrac{7 S_A}{S_A-1}+2=\dfrac{7 S_B}{S_B+1}</tex>
    <tex>7 S_A+2=7 S_B</tex>
    <reason>%text
Distance covered by $M_A$ running at $S_A$ to
reach the meeting 7 hr away is $7S_A$. Distance
covered by $M_B$ to reach the same meeting
is $7S_B$.
But $M_A$ running at $(S_A-1)$ km/h took two
hours longer in getting back than $M_B$ running
at $(S_B+1)$ km/h did. Putting this in equation
form,
%
\begin{align}
  &amp;\overbrace{\dfrac{7S_A}{S_A-1}(hr)}^\text{$M_A$ return time}
  -\overbrace{\dfrac{7S_B}{S_B+1}(hr)}^\text{$M_B$ return time}
  =\overbrace{2(hr)}^\text{time difference} 
\end{align} </reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>\dfrac{7 S_A}{S_A-1}+2=\dfrac{7 S_B}{S_B+1} \\
S_A+S_B=14 \\
%text
What are $S_A$ and $S_B$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
$S_A=8$ km/h, $S_B=6$ km/h
%</tex>
    <tex>%text
$S_A=6$ km/h, $S_B=8$ km/h
%</tex>
    <reason>\dfrac{7 S_A}{S_A-1}+2=\dfrac{7 S_B}{S_B+1} \\
%text
can be re-written as,
%
\begin{align}
  &amp;{\small 7S_A(S_B+1)-7S_B(S_A-1)=2(S_A-1)(S_B-1)} \\
  &amp;\qquad\text{but }S_A+S_B=14, \\
  &amp;\therefore 14=2(14S_A-S_A^2)+S_A-14+S_A-1) \\
  &amp;\implies S_A^2-16S_A+64=0 \\
  &amp;\implies (S_A-8)^2=0 \implies S_A=8 \text{ km/h}
\end{align} \\
\therefore S_B=14-8=6\text{ km/h}
