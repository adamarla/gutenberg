A small aircraft encounters bad weather a
third of the way into a $600$ km flight and has
to slow down by $50$ km/h. As a result, it
lands $40$ minutes later than usual. How long
does the aircraft take to fly the same route on
a clear clear day?

If the flight were broken down to 3 equal
legs, as per the problem what would the
speed of the aircraft be in each leg?

    <tex correct='true'>\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
  \text{Leg} &amp; 1^{st} &amp; 2^{nd} &amp; 3^{rd} \\

    <reason>%text
As per the problem, bad weather hit after
the first third of the flight had passed. And
due to this, the aircraft had to reduce its
regular cruising speed by $50$(km/h). If the
regular speed of the aircraft during the first
third of the flight path was ${\it s}$ km/h, then 
during the second and last thirds it would 
slow down to ${\it (s-50)}$ km/h.

If it takes the aircraft flying at ${\bf s}$ km/h, ${\bf m}$
minutes to fly the $600$ km route on a clear 
day, what is the correct expression for ${\bf m}$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>m=\dfrac{600\times 60}{s}=\dfrac{3600}{s}</tex>
    <tex>m=\dfrac{600}{s\times 60}=\dfrac{10}{s}</tex>
    <reason>%text
Speed is defined as distance covered over
time elapsed. Using this relation we can
connect speed, distance and time, taking 
into account the units for each of them,
%
\begin{align}
  \overbrace{\dfrac{m(min)}{60(min/h)}}^\text{time}
    &amp;=\dfrac{\overbrace{600(km)}^\text{distance}}
                {\underbrace{s(km/h)}_\text{speed}} \\
  \implies m(min)&amp;=\dfrac{600 (\st{km})\times 60 (min/\st{h})}
                                       {s (\st{km/h})} \\
    &amp;=\dfrac{600\times 60 (min)}{s}=\dfrac{3600}{s}(min)
\end{align}

On a clear day the aircraft flies at $s$ km/h
taking $\frac{3600}{s}$ minutes to complete the flight.
What is the correct expression for the $40$ 
minute delay due to which the flight had to 
go $50$ km/h slower in the last two-third?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>40=\left(\dfrac{200\times 60}{s}
  +\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}\right)-\dfrac{3600}{s}</tex>
    <tex>40=\left(\dfrac{200\times 60}{s-50}
  +\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}\right)-\dfrac{3600}{s}</tex>
    <reason>%text
On the bad weather day, if the aircraft
took $t_1$ minutes for the first one-third of
the journey and $t_2$ minutes for the rest
then,
%
\begin{align}
  t_1 &amp;= \dfrac{200 (km)}{\dfrac{s}{60}(km/min)}
    =\dfrac{200\times 60}{s} (min) \\
  t_2 &amp;=\dfrac{400 (km)}{\dfrac{(s-50)}{60}(km/min)}
    =\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}(min)
\end{align} \\
%text
Combining $t_1$ and $t_2$ and subtracting from
the regular journey time we get,
%
\begin{align}
  \overbrace{40 (min)}^\text{delay}&amp;=
    \overbrace{\dfrac{200\times 60}{s}}^\text{    time \\ first-third}
      +\overbrace{\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}}^\text{      time \\ last two-third}
      -\overbrace{\dfrac{3600}{s}}^\text{usual time}     
\end{align}</reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>40=\left(\dfrac{200\times 60}{s}
  +\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}\right)-\dfrac{3600}{s} \\
%text
What is/are the value(s) of $s$, if $s$ represents 
speed of the aircraft on a clear day?
%  </context>
    <tex correct='true'>s=200 (km/h)</tex>
    <tex>s=200(km/h), -150 (km/h)</tex>
    <reason>\begin{align}
  &amp;40=\left(\dfrac{200\times 60}{s}
    +\dfrac{400\times 60}{s-50}\right)-\dfrac{3600}{s} \\
  \implies &amp; \dfrac{40}{60}=\dfrac{200}{s}-\dfrac{600}{s}+\dfrac{400}{s-50} \\
  \implies &amp; s^2-50s-600 \left(50\right)=0 \\
  \implies &amp; s^2+150s-200s-(200\times 150)=0 \\
  \implies &amp; (s+150)(s-200)=0 \\
  \implies &amp; s=-150, s=200
\end{align} \\
%text
Since $s$ represents the speed of the plane, we
reject the negative value. Therefore the speed
of the plane is $200$ km/h.
