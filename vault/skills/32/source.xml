If you see an expression that looks 
too big or too complicated  \underline\text{OR} 
looks like something you need but not 
exactly, then perhaps it is time to 
\underline\text{change how the expression looks}

There are no rules on what will work.
It depends on the expression and 
what you need to do with it. 

Hence, get creative and use your 
intuition. \underline\text{Math isn't just about rules!}
