Identifying what \underline\text{substitutions}
to make -- and when

  </render>
  <reason>
    <tex>%text
There will be times when you
will have an equation or expression 
that \underline\text{looks like - but isn't exactly like}
something you know. 

Perhaps it is time to make a 
substitution and \underline\text{change the form} 
of the equation. 

\underline\text{There are no standard rules} about
what substitution to make. 

\underline\text{You will just have to use your intuition }
