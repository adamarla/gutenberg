    <tex>%text
Mathematical notation might look confusing
but is nothing more than short-hand. 

Get familiar with at least the basic symbols 
like $\therefore$ (therefore), $\because$ (because), $\forall$ (for all),
$\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers), $\mathbb{Z}$ (integers), $\sum$ (sum)
etc. 

Once you do, you will be able to express 
complex ideas \underline\text{quickly and precisely}.
