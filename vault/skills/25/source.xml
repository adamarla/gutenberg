Expressing one polynomial as the 
\underline\text{product} of two or more other 
polynomials is called factorization. 

For example, 
%
\begin{align}
	x^2 - 3x + 2 &amp;= (x-1)\cdot (x-2) \\ 
	x^3-1 &amp;= (x-1)\cdot (x^2 + x + 1) \\
	x^4 - 1 &amp;= (x-1)\cdot (x+1)\cdot (x^2 + 1)
\end{align}
%text


Factorizing is something you will do 
often in the course of your studies. 

So, it is best if you get comfortable 
with it.
