\textbf{Definition}

A differential equation relates a
function with its derivatives

\[ 3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0\] 
is, for example, a differential equation


It is also an \underline\text{ordinary} differential
equation because it has only $y', y''$
type terms. There are also partial 
differential equations. But those are
taught at university level. 

\textbf{Order} 
The order of a differential equation is 
the order of the \underline\text{highest order derivative}
in the equation

\[ 3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0\] 
has \underline\text{order equal to 2} because of $\left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right)$

\textbf{Degree}
The degree of a differential equation is
the \underline\text{highest power} of the \underline\text{highest order}
derivative in the equation

\[ 3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0\] 
has \underline\text{degree equal to 37} 

\textbf{Degrees are not always defined!}
A degree is only defined for differential 
equations that are \underline\text{polynomial} 
in $y,y',y"$ etc.
