\textbf{Definition}

A differential equation relates a
function with its derivatives

\[ 3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0\] 
is, for example, a differential equation \newline 

It is also an \underline{ordinary} differential
equation because it has only $y', y''$
type terms \newline 

\textbf{Order} 
The order of a differential equation is 
the order of the \underline{highest order} derivative
in the equation

For example, $3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0$ has \underline{order} equal to 2 because of $\left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right)$\newline 


\textbf{Degree}
The degree of a differential equation is
the \underline{highest power} of the \underline{highest} order
derivative in the equation\newline 

For example, $3\left(\frac{d^2y }{dx^2}\right)^{37} - \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{100} + x = 0$  has \underline{degree} equal to 37 \newline 

\textbf{Degrees are not always defined!}

A degree is only defined for differential 
equations that are \underline{polynomial}
in $y,y',y"$ etc.
