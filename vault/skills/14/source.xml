The \underline\text{ concept} of conditional probability
answers the following question

\textit{What is the probability of an event A}
\textit{happening \underline\text{ given that} event B already has?}

Thomas Bayes was the first to provide
the following \underline\text{mathematical} formula for 
evaluating conditional probabilities. 

\[ P\left( A\vert B\right) = \dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{P(B\vert A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}  \]
