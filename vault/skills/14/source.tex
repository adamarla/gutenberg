    Conditional probability answers the following question\newline

\small{What is the probability of an event \textbf{A happening} given that
event \bf{B has already happened}}\normalsize \newline 


Thomas Bayes was the first to provide
the following \underline{mathematical formula} for 
evaluating conditional probabilities 

\[ P\left( A\vert B\right) = \dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{P(B\vert A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}  \]
