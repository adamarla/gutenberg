Since the components along each unit vector are in the same direction, any two vectors $\ora{A}$ and $\ora{B}$ can be added/subtracted as shown.
%
\begin{align}
  \ora{A}&amp;=\vector{a_1}{a_2}{a_3} \\
  \ora{B}&amp;=\vector{b_1}{b_2}{b_3} \\
  \ora{A}\pm\ora{B}&amp;=\vector{(a_1\pm b_1)}{(a_2\pm b_2)}{(a_3\pm b_3)}
\end{align} \\
%text
Further, their displacement vector $\ora{AB}$ is given by $\ora{B}-\ora{A}$. If $\ora{A}$, $\ora{B}$ and $\ora{C}$ are three vectors then,
%
\begin{align}
  \ora{AB}+\ora{BC}=\ora{AC}
\end{align} \\
%text
This is known as the{\bf triangle law} of vector addition.
