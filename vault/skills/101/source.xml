If $\theta$ is the angle between two planes, then it is also the angle between their respective normals. The angle between the normals of two planes $A_1x+B_1y+C_1z+D_1=0$ and $A_2x+B_2y+C_2z+D_2=0$ is given by,
%
\begin{align}
  \cos\theta &amp;= \left\vert\dfrac{A_1A_2+B_1B_2+C_1C2}
    {\sqrt{A_1^2+B_1^2+C_1^2}\sqrt{A_1^2+B_1^2+C_1^2}}\right\vert    
\end{align} \\

%text
where $A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$ and $A_2$, $B_2$, $C_2$ are the respective direction ratios of the two planes.

If the planes were described in vector form, $\ora{r}\cdot\ora{n}=d_1$ and $\ora{r}\cdot\ora{n}=d_2$, then the angle between the planes (or their normals) is given by,
%
\begin{align}
  \cos\theta = \left\vert\dfrac{\ora{n_1}\cdot\ora{n_2}}
    {|\ora{n_1}||\ora{n_2}|} \right\vert
\end{align}</tex>
