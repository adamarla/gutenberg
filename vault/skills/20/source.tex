Getting $r$ heads in $n$ coin flips
\end{narrow}

%text
Imagine a task (like flipping a coin) that
could either be a success (getting heads)
or a failure (getting tails)\newline

If this task is done $n$ times, then what
is the probability of getting $r$ successes?\newline 

If we were to write the probabilities out, then we would get a table like 
the one below 

%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{NNNNN}
\midrule 
r & 0 & 1 & \ldots & n \\
\midrule 
P(r) & p_0 & p_1 & \ldots & p_n \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

%text
Notice that this is simply a probability distribution. But it goes by a 
special name -- binomial distribution \newline 

That said, $P(r)$ in the table above is
\[P(r) = ^nC_r\cdot p^r\cdot q^{(n-r)} \text{ where } q = 1- p \]
