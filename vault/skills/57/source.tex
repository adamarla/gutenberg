\textcolor{blue}{Equation of a line in $x-y$ plane}

How to find the equation given two points on the line or one point and the line's slope
%

\newcard

%text
The following two are the only facts you need to remember about lines in 2D plane 

\begin{itemize}
\item{Only one line can pass through
two points} 
\item{Whilst infinite lines can pass
through a point, only one of those 
lines can have a given slope} 
\end{itemize} 

In the table below, $A$ and $B$ are two points and $m$ is the slope of the line\newline 

Depending on what you know, the table also shows \underline{how to find the equation}  of the line \newline 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{NNNN}
  \toprule
        A & B & m & \text{Equation}  \\
   \midrule
   \checkmark & \checkmark & \text{X} & \frac{y-y_A}{x- x_A} = \frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} \\
   \midrule 
   \checkmark  & \text{X}  & \checkmark & \frac{y-y_A}{x-x_A} = m \\ 
   \midrule 
   \text{X} & \checkmark & \checkmark & \frac{y - y_B}{x-x_B} = m \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{\small{If given the intercepts}}

If you are told that the line cuts the $x$-axis at $A = \left(a,0 \right)$ and 
the $y$-axis at $B = \left(0,b \right)$, then the equation of the line is 

\begin{align}
\frac{y - 0}{x-a} &= \frac{b-0}{0-a} \implies -ay = bx - ba \\
\therefore bx + ay &= ba \implies \underbrace{\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1}_{\text{Divide throught by $a\cdot b$}}\\
\end{align}
