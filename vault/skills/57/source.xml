Below are two facts about lines in 
a 2D plane that are the backbone
of this chapter 

$\quad\bullet$ Only one line can pass through
two points $A$ and $B$
$\quad\bullet$ Whilst infinite lines can pass
through a point, only one of those 
lines can have a given slope $(m)$

The above two facts give rise to 
the following equation forms for 
a line. 

\textbf{Given two points}
Given two point  $A=(x_A, y_a)$ 
and $B = (x_B, y_B)$

\[ \qquad \dfrac{y-y_A}{x-x_A} = \underbrace{\dfrac{y_A-y_B}{x_A - x_B}}_{\text{Slope } m}\]

If $A = (x_A, 0)$ and $B = (0,y_B)$ be 
where the line cuts the $x$ and $y$ axis
respectively, then 

\[ \qquad \dfrac{x}{x_A} + \dfrac{y}{y_B} = 1 \]

\textbf{One point + Slope}
If you know only $A$ and $m$ -- but 
not $B$, then 

\[ \qquad \dfrac{y-y_A}{x - x_A} = m \]
