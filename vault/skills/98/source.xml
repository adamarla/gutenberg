- A matrix is an ordered array of numbers or functions
- A matrix having $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called a matrix of order $m\times n$
- If $m=n$ an $m\times n$ matrix is called a \underline\text{square matrix}
- A \underline\text{symmetric matrix} is a square matrix whose non-diagonal elements ($i\neq j$) satisfy $a_{ij}=a_{ji}$
- A \underline\text{diagonal matrix} is a square matrix whose non-diagonal elements $a_{ij}$ when $i\neq j$ are all $0$
- A \underline\text{scalar matrix} is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to some constant $k$
- An \underline\text{identity matrix} is a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all $1$. It is usually denoted by $I$
- $M\times I=M$, any matrix multiplied by Identity matrix results in that matrix itself
