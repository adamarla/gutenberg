- A matrix is an ordered array of numbers or functions
- A matrix having $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called a matrix of order $m\times n$
- If $m=n$ an $m\times n$ matrix is called a \underline\text{square matrix}
- Two matrices can only be added if they are of the same order
- To add to matrices, simply add their corresponding elements
- A \underline\text{diagonal matrix} is a square matrix whose non-diagonal elements $a_{ij}$ when $i\neq j$ are all $0$
- An \underline\text{identity matrix} is a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all $1$. It is usually denoted by $I$
