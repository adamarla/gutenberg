Ordinarily, we expect curves to
be of the form $y = f(x)$ 

But if both $x$ and $y$ are expressed
in terms of a third variable/parameter,
then we have what is called a 
\underline\text{parametric curve}

Instead of one $y = f(x)$ type equation,
we will have two equations in terms 
of the parameter $(t)$

\[ \quad x = f(t) \text{ and } y = g(t) \]

 \underline\text{The curve is still plotted in $x-y} 
 It is only expressed in terms of $t$

 \underline\text{Coordinates of a point $A$}
 A point $A$ on the curve will have 
 the coordinates 
 \[ \qquad A = (x,y) = \left(f(t), g(t) \right)\]

 \underline\text{Slope of the tangent at $A$}
 The slope of the tangent will continue
 to be $\frac{dy}{dx}$. However, 

 \[ \quad \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy / dt}{dx / dt}\]
