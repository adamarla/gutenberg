\textcolor{blue}{Inferring facts about a line}

Given the equation of line, finding it's slope, point of intersection with another line, intercepts etc. 
\end{narrow}

\reason 

Sometimes you will have to find the equation of a line given its slope, points it passes through etc \newline 

And at other times, you will have to do the opposite \newline 

You will be \underline{given the equation} of a line and you will have to 
figure out the line's slope, where it intersects with another line, it's $x-$ and $y-$ intercepts etc \newline 

So, given a line $L_1: ax + by + c = 0$, re-write it as 
\[ \qquad y = -\frac{a}{b} x - \frac{c}{b}\]

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cNN}
  \toprule 
        & \text{Value}  & \text{How?} \\
   \midrule
   Slope & m = -\frac{a}{b} & y = mx + c \\  
    \midrule 
    $x$-intercept & -\frac{c}{a} & \text{Put }y = 0 \\
    \midrule 
    $y$-intercept & -\frac{c}{b} & \text{Put } x= 0 \\ 
    \midrule 
    Point of intersection & & \text{Solve } y = m_1 x + c_1 \\
    & & = m_2 x + c_2 \\ 
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
