Finding the \underline\text{largest term numerically}
in the expansion of $(a+b)^n,\, a,b\gt 0$

If $a,b\gt 0$, then every term in the
expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is also $\gt 0$. 

Now, if $T_{m+1}$ be the $m-$th term and 
$T_m$ be the $(m-1)-$th term, then as 
long as \[ \frac{T_{m+1}}{T_m}\geq 1\], the terms are 
increasing. 

\underline\text{The last $m,\,m\in\mathbb{Z^+}$} for which this
is true will give us the largest term.
