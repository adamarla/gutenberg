By definition, \[ \log_b a = c \implies b^c = a \]
The above expression is read as 
\underline\text{$\log$ of $a$ to the base $b$ equals $c$}. 

Most of the time, however, we would
only be writing $\log a = c$. 

It is understood that the logarithm 
is to the \underline\text{base $e$}

\begin{align}
\log (m\cdot n) &amp;= \log m + \log n \\
\log \frac{m}{n} &amp;= \log m - \log n \\ 
e^{\log m} &amp;= m \\
