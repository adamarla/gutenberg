    In word problems, you will be given the facts of the case in a natural language like English \newline 
    
    But to apply logic, you will need to express these facts in mathematical notation\newline 
    
    Hence, take one fact at a time and write the Math for it. As you do, you will start getting insights into how to solve the problem
