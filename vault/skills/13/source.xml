Working with piece-wise functions

Ordinarily, we work with functions that have 
the same definition over the entire domain. 

But then, a function may be defined differently
in different regions of it's domain. Such a 
function is said to be defined in pieces - or 
piece-wise defined. 

One such function is $f(x) = \vert x\vert$ - which is 
defined differently for $x\geq 0$ and $x\lt 0$. 

%
\[ \qquad f(x) = \begin{cases} 
-x, x\lt 0 \\
x, x\geq 0 
\end{cases} \]</tex>
