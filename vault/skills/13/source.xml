When a function is defined differently in
different regions of it's domain, we say
that the function is  defined in pieces - 
or \underline\text{piece-wise defined}.

For example, $f(x) = \vert x\vert$ is defined as 

%
\[ \qquad f(x) = \begin{cases} 
-x, x\lt 0 \\
x, x\geq 0 
\end{cases} \]
%text

Notice, the different definitions for 
$x\geq 0$ and $x\lt 0$
