Ability to read, understand \& work with piece-wise defined functions

    \reason 

When a function is defined differently in
different regions of it's domain, we say
that the function is  defined in pieces - 
or 

\underline{piece-wise defined}\newline 

For example, $f(x) = \vert x\vert$ is defined as 

\[ \qquad f(x) = \begin{cases} 
-x, x < 0 \\
x, x\geq 0 
\end{cases} \]
%text

Notice, the different definitions of $f(x)$ for 
$x\geq 0$ and $x <  0$
