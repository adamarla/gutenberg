Meaning of a relation $R$ in sets $A$ and $B$
%</tex>

    <tex>%text
A relation in sets $A$ and $B$ is an arbitrary
subset of $A\times B$ which satisfies some condition. 
Consider the sets 
$A=\{1,2\}$, and $B=\{5,6,7\}$.
%
\begin{align}
  A\times B =&amp; \{1,5\}, \{1,6\}, \{1,7\}, \{2,5\}, \\ 
  &amp;\{2,6\},\{2,7\}    
\end{align} \\
%text
If $R=\{(a,b):b=a+4\}$, not all the above
pairs satisfy this condition. For instance,
%
\qquad
\begin{align}
  \{1,6\}&amp;\implies  b=a+5 \\
  \{2,5\}&amp;\implies b=a+3
\end{align} \\
%text
The only pair that satisfies the condition
for the relation is $\{3,5\}$ $(\because 5=3+2)$. 
\therefore the relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is $\{3,5\}$.
Note: A relation can also be in set $A$ alone.
In this case, it would be a subset of $A\times A$.
