Meaning of a relation $R$ in sets $A$ and $B$
%</tex>
  </render>
  <reason>
    <tex>%text
A relation in sets $A$ and $B$ is an arbitrary subset of $A\times B$ which satisfies some condition.  Consider the sets $A$ and $B$ where $A=\{1,2\}$, and $B=\{5,6,7\}$. All possible combinations of $A$ and $B$ are,
%
\begin{align}
  A\times B =&amp; \{1,5\}, \{1,6\}, \{1,7\}, \\ 
  &amp;\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{2,7\}    
\end{align} \\
%text
If we define a Relation $R$ between $A$ and $B$ such that $R=\{(a,b):b=a+4\}$, not all the above
pairs satisfy this condition. For instance,
%
\begin{align}
  \{1,6\}&amp;\implies  b=a+5 \\
  \{2,5\}&amp;\implies b=a+3
\end{align} \\
%text
In fact the only pair that satisfies the condition for the relation is 
%
\begin{align}
  \{3,5\}\because 5=3+2
\end{align} \\
%text
\therefore the relation $R$ from $A$ to $B$ is $\{3,5\}$.

Note: A relation can also be in set $A$ alone. In this case, it would be a subset of $A\times A$.
