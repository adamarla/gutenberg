Let $A$ run twice as fast as $B$ and 
$B$ run 3 times as fast as $C$. Then 
how fast does $A$ run compared to $C$? 

The answer is simple -- $(2\times 3 = 6)$

That was the Chain Rule. And it 
works just the same way with 
functions. 

\textbf{Chain Rule} 
Let $f(x)$ be a composite function. 

\[ \quad f(x) = g\left[ h(x) \right] = (g\circ h)(x) \] 

In other words, $f(x)$ is made by 
\underline\text{applying $g(x)$ on $h(x)$}. Then, 

\[\qquad \frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \frac{dg}{dh}\times\dfrac{dh}{dx}  \]
