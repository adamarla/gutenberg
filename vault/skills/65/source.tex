A circle is the locus of all points that are equi-distant from a given point (known as the center) \newline 

The figure above shows a circle whose center is at the origin $O$\newline 

It does not have to be though. The center can be at any point $(a,b)$\newline 

The \underline{standard equation} of a circle with center at $(a,b)$ and radius $R$   is 
\[ \qquad \left(x-a \right)^2 + \left(y-b \right)^2 = R^2 \]

When the center is at the origin, that is $(a,b) = (0,0)$, then this boils down to 
\[ \qquad x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \]
