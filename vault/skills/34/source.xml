\textbf{Continuity at $x=a$}
A function $f(x)$ is continuous at 
a point $x=a$ if 
\[ \qquad \lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to a^+}f(x) = f(a)\]

In other words, $f(x)$ is continous at
$x=a$ if it \underline\text{converges to the value}
of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ from both the left 
and the right of $x=a$

\textbf{Continuity in $(b,c)$}
A function is continuous \underline\text{in an interval}
$(b,c)$ if it is continuous \underline\text{at every $a\in(b,c)$}

\textbf{Continuity in $[b,c]$}
$x=b$ and $x=c$ are allowed in a closed
interval like $[b,c]$. Hence, the condition
for continuity needs to be modified slightly

$f(x)$ is continuous in $[b,c]$ if 

$\quad\bullet$ $f(x)$ is continuous in $ (b,c)$ 
$\quad\bullet$ \[ \lim_{x\to b^+} f(x) = f(b) \]
$\quad\bullet$ \[ \lim_{x\to c^-} f(x) = f(c) \]
