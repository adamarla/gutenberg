\textcolor{blue}{\text{Recognizing the type}}
Is it an ordinary differential eqn.?
Is it homogenous or linear?

At school level, you will be asked 
to solve only the following types of
differential equations 
% 
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp;= f(x,y) = g(x)\cdot h(y) \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &amp;= f(x,y) = g\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \text{ (homogenous)} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} + Py &amp;= Q \text{ (first-order linear) }
\end{align}

%text


Notice that all of the above equations
have \underline\text{order one and degree one}. 

Only when you know the type of the 
equation can you pick the correct 
technique for solving it.
