Is it ordinary, homogenous or first-order linear

At school level, you will be asked 
to solve only the following types of
differential equations 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cN}
   \toprule
        Type & \text{Looks like} \\
   \midrule 
   Ordinary & \dydx = g(x)\cdot h(y) \\
    \midrule 
    Homogenous & \dydx = f \left(\frac{y}{x} \right) \\
    \midrule 
    First order linear & \dydx + P(x)\cdot y = Q(x) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Notice that all of the above differential equations
have \underline{order one and degree one}\newline 

Each of the above equations has a different technique for solving 
it. Hence, one must first identify the type of the differential 
equation
