\textcolor{blue}{Recognizing the type}

Is it an ordinary differential equation?
Is it homogenous or linear? 
\end{narrow}

%text
At school level, you will be asked 
to solve only the following types of
differential equations 
% 
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= f(x,y) = g(x)\cdot h(y) \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= f(x,y) = g\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\text{ (homogenous)} \\
\frac{dy}{dx} + Py &= Q  \text{ (first-order linear)}
\end{align}\newline 

Notice that all of the above equations
have \underline{order one and degree one}\newline 

Only when you know the type of an equation can you pick the correct technique for solving it
