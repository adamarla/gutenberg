\question[4] \text{\vc } people meet in a room. Each person shakes hands with all others just once. 
How many handshakes in total would have been done?

\watchout

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  Two people are needed to do one handshake. And a handshake between $A$ and $B$ is the same 
  as a handshake between $B$ and $A$. 

  Hence, the total number of handshakes is simply 
  \[ N_{\text{total}} = \binom\va{2} = \dfrac{\va !}{2!\cdot (\va-2)!} = \vb \] 
\end{solution}
