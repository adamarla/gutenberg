\question How many distinct permutations of the letters of the word \text{\vw } do not begin with $\vf$ but end with $\vl$?

\watchout

\begin{solution}
  The word \text{\vw } has $\vn$ characters. For now, let us treat all characters as distinct, 
  including the two $\vr$'s - which we will call $\vr_1$ and $\vr_2$.

  If the last character has to be $\vl$ and the first cannot be $\vf$, then we 
  have $\vn-2=\vb$ options for the first character. 

  With two characters taken (first and last), the middle $\vb$ can be permuted in $\vb !$ ways. 
  Had all characters been distinct, our answer would have been 
  \[ X = \vb\cdot\vb ! \]

  But in any of the above $X$ permutations, switching the two $\vr$s results in the same word. 

  And as the two $\vr$s can be permuted amongst themselves in $2!$ ways, the number of \textbf{distinct} permutations is 
  \[ N_{\text{final}} = \dfrac{X}{2!} = \dfrac{\vb\cdot\vb!}{2!} = \vz \] 
\end{solution}
