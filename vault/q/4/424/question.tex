\question[4] There are $\vn$ stations on a railway line. If the price of a ticket depends on 
which two stations one is travelling between, then how many differently priced tickets can there be? 
The fare from $A\to B$ is equal to the fare from $B\to A$.

\watchout

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  The number of ways in which two out of $\vn$ stations can be picked is 
  \[ N = \binom\vn{2} = \dfrac{\vn !}{2!\cdot (\vn-2)!} = \vz \]
  As a train journey is defined by which two stations it is between, the above 
  number is also the number of distinct journeys that can be made. 

  And as each journey has its own ticket price, 
  \[ N_{\text{tickets}} = \vz \] 
\end{solution}
