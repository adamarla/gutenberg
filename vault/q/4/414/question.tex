\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
The first two digits are fixed as 6 and 7 and no digit repeats itself. \\ 
Thus, the three digits are to be chosen from remaining of the 8 digits.\\ \\
We can pick the units place from the 8 digits in 8 ways. Now this can't be repeated so have to pick the tens place from 7 digits in 7 ways and the hundredth from 6 digits in 6 ways.\\
Thus, using multiplication method the number of ways are : $8\times 7 \times 6 = 336$      
\end{solution}
