$336$ apples are distributed equally amongst
a certain number of students. Had there been
$6$ more students, each would have got one
apple less. How many students are there?

If $1=\dfrac{336}{N}-\dfrac{336}{N+6}$, what is $N$?

If $336$ apples were to be distributed equally
among $N$ people, each person's share would 
be $\dfrac{336}{N}$
If there were $6$ more people, each person's
share would decrease by $1$ to $\dfrac{336}{N+6}$

\therefore 1=\dfrac{336}{N}-\dfrac{336}{N+6}</tex>

      <reason>
         <tex>\begin{align}
  &amp; 1=\dfrac{336}{N}-\dfrac{336}{N+6} \\
  \implies &amp; 1=336\left(\dfrac{1}{N}-\dfrac{1}{N+6}\right) \\
  \implies &amp; N(N+6)=336 \left(N+6-N \right) \\
  \implies &amp; N^2+6N-2016=0 \\
  \implies &amp; N^2-42N+48N-2016=0 \\
  \implies &amp; N(N-42)+48(N-48)=0 \\
  \implies &amp; N=42, N=-48
\end{align} \\
%text
Since there cannot be negative number of 
people therefore, $N=42$
