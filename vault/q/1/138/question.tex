\question[1] $\vn$ apples are distributed equally amongst a certain number of students. 
Had there been $\vd$ more students, each would have got one apple less. How many students
are there? 

\watchout 

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $N$ be the number of students, then each would get $\dfrac\vn{N}$ apples. 

	With $\vd$ more students, each would get $\dfrac\vn{N+\vd}$ apples. And so, 
	
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac\vn{N} - \dfrac\vn{N+\vd} &= 1 \implies N^2 + \vd N - \vm = 0 \\
		\implies N &= \va,\vb
	\end{align}
	$N = \vb$ does not make sense. And therefore $N=\va$
\end{solution}
