\question[5] Let us suppose that there is a set $S$ and that there are two ways of building it - 
either by doing a union of $\vc$ sets of type X or by union of $N$ sets of type Y.
Mathematically, 
    \[ S = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\vc} X_i = \bigcup_{j=1}^N Y_j\]
Each $X$ has $\va$ elements and each $Y$ has $\vb$ elements. And if each element in $S$ belongs to 
exactly $\vd$ of the $X_i$ and to exactly $\ve$ of the $Y_j$, then \textbf{ what is $N=?$}

\texttt{Note: The above union is possible only if for every $x\in X_i$ (for some $i$), it is also true that $x\in Y_j$ 
(for some $j$) and vice-versa}

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
  If there were no common elements between any of the $X_R$s - that is - 
  if $X_i\cap X_j = \phi,i\neq j$ for all pairs $(i,j)$, then $S$ would have 
  $=\vc\times\va = \vx$ elements

  But, we have been told that each element in $S$ belongs to exactly $\vd$ of the $X_R$s.
  Which means, $S$ has $ =\dfrac\vx\vd = \vunique$ \textbf{unique} elements

  Similarly, if $S$ is built from the $Y_R$s, then it would have $=\dfrac{\vb\times N}{\ve}$ 
  unique elements 

  But because it is the same set $S$, 
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{\vb\times N}{\ve} &= \vunique \\
    \implies N &= \vy
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
