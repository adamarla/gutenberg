\question[5]  The National Bank of the Shire has a 3-year investment scheme
for its residents whereby they get 4\% interest compounded annually in the 
first year and - if they do not make a withdrawl at the end of the first year - 
4.5\% interest compounded annually in the next 2 years. However, if they do make
a withdrawl, then they get the same 4\% for the next 2 years too

Frodo Baggins invests in this scheme. But at the end of the first year, 
he needed cash in hand and was forced to withdraw 20\% of his original principal amount.
How much did he lose in the way of interest at the end of the 3-year period because
of the withdrawl?

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	Had Frodo \textit{not} withdrawn the amount at the end of the first year, he would have
	 got - at the end of the 3 years,
	\begin{align}
		P_1 &= P_0\cdot\left(1+\dfrac{4}{100}\right)\cdot\left(1+\dfrac{4.5}{100}\right)^{2} \\
		    &= 1.136\cdot P_0
	\end{align}
	
	Which means an interest payment of
	\begin{align}
		I_1 &= 1.136 P_0 - P_0 = 0.136 P_0
	\end{align}
	
	But he did. And so, he would now get at the end of the third year
	\begin{align}
		P_2 &= \overbrace{(1.04-0.2)\cdot P_0}^{\texttt{new start amount}}\cdot
		\underbrace{\left( 1 + \dfrac{4}{100}\right)^2}_{\texttt{still getting 4\%}} \\
		&= 0.9085\cdot P_0
	\end{align}
	
	Which means, that over the 3-years, Frodo earned interest equal to
	\begin{align}
		I_2 &= \overbrace{(1.04 - 1)\cdot P_0}^{\texttt{first year}} + 
		       \overbrace{(0.9085 - 0.84)\cdot P_0}^{\texttt{Years 2 \& 3}} \\
		    &= 	0.1085\cdot P_0
	\end{align}
	
	Hence, Frodo lost = $(0.136 - 0.1085)\cdot P_0 = 0.0275\cdot P_0$ - or 2.75\% - as interest 
	payment because of the withdrawl
