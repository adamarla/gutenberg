It is standard practice to take a chest
X-ray of a person suspected of having 
tuberculosis (TB). The probability of 
detecting TB in a person actually suffering
from it is $\dfrac{99}{100}$. However, the probability 
of a healthy person being diagnosed with 
TB is $\dfrac{9}{1000}$. In a certain city, 1 in 600 
people suffers from TB. A person is selected 
at random and is diagnosed with TB. 

What is the probability that the person 
actually has TB?
