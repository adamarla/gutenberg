is added to the number, then its digits interchange their places. What is the 
number?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	If $x$ and $y$ be the two digits - in the units and tens places respectively - then
	\begin{align}
		\text{ Number } &= 10\cdot y + x 
	\end{align}
	With the digits interchanged, the \textit{new} number is 
	\begin{align}
		\text{New number } &= 10\cdot x + y \\
		                   &= (10\cdot y + x) + 9 \\
		   \implies x - y &= 1
	\end{align}
	Given that $xy = 20$, the above reduces to 
	\begin{align}
		x - \dfrac{20}{x} &= 1 \\
		\implies x^2 - x - 20 &= 0 \\
		\text{or, } x &= -4, 5 \implies y = \dfrac{20}{x} = -5, 4
	\end{align}
	The two possible numbers - yes, there would be two - are $10\cdot4 + 5 = 45$ 
	and $10\cdot (-5) + (-4) = -54$
