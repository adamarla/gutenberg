A cooperative society of farmers has 50 hectares
of land to grow two crops A and B. The profits
from crops A and B per hectare are estimated
as &#8377; 10,500 and &#8377; 9000 respectively. To
control weeds, a liquid herbicide has to be 
used for crops A and B at the rate of 20 litres
and 10 litres per hectare respectively. Further
not more than 800 litres of herbicide should
be used in order to protect fish and wildlife 
using a pond which collects drainage from 
this land. Keeping in mind that the protection
and other wildlife is more important than
earning profit, how much land should be
allocated to each crop so as to maximize
the total profit? Form an LPP from the above
and solve it graphically.

Begin the problem by collecting all the facts. 

\underline{\text{Available land}}\\
We don't have more than 50 hectares of land. 
Hence, $L_A + L_B \leq 50$. 

\underline\text{Herbicide}\\
We would need 20 litres\it{ per hectare} of 
herbicide for crop A and 10 litres \it{per hectare} 
for crop B. 

Hence, we would need $20L_A + 10L_B$. But we 
we cannot use more than 800 litres total.  
So, $20L_A + 10L_B\leq 800 \implies 2L_A + L_B \leq 80.$

\underline\text{Profit}\\
And we must maximize profits.
\[ \text{Profit} = \pi = 10,500\cdot L_A + 9,000\cdot L_B \]

         <tex>%text
If we plot $L_A$ along the x-axis and $L_B$ along
the y-axis, then the two lines we need are
%
\begin{align}
L_B &amp;= 80 - 2L_A \\ 
L_B &amp;= 50 - L_A 
\end{align}

You can confirm that 
%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
a &amp; b &amp; c &amp; d &amp; e \\ 
\hline 
(0,80) &amp; (0,50) &amp; (30,20) &amp; (40,0) &amp; (50,0) \\
\hline
\end{tabular} \\
%text
Moreover, as we have to satisfy both constraints
(on land and herbicide use), the feasible region
has to \underline\text{below points b,c and d}.

Only points in this region are below \underline\text{both}
the lines.

We identified three possible optimal
points in Step 2. We now only have to 
calculate the profit at each of these 
points and compare. 
%
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\text{Point} &amp; \text{Coordinates }(L_A,L_B) &amp; \text{Profit} \\
\hline 
b &amp; (0,50) &amp; &#8377; 450,000 \\
\hline 
c &amp; (30,20) &amp; &#8377; 495,000 \\
\hline
d &amp; (40,0) &amp; &#8377; 420,000 \\
\hline 
\end{tabular} \\
%text
It is obvious from the table that with 30 
hectares given to crop A and 20 hectares
to crop B, our profits will be maximum.
