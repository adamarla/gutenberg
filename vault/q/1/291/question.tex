\question A man wants to invite $\va$ friends for a get-together at his place and he has 
$\vb$ messengers he can use to deliver the invitations. The invitations are \textit{not}
personalized - that is, any of the invited individuals can receive any of the invitation cards.

\watchout

\begin{parts} 
  \part[2] In how many ways can the invitations be delivered if its ok to \textit{not} use one or more of the messengers? 

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
     As the invitations are \textit{not} personalized, the problem is the same as the one about the numbers of ways 
     in which $N$ items can be distributed amongst $M$ individuals 
     \begin{align}
     	N &= \eDistNAmongstM{N}{M} \\
        \text{ which in this case} &= \eDistNAmongstM{\va}{\vb} = \vc
     \end{align}
  \end{solution}

  \part[2] In how many ways can the invitations be delivered if \textit{all} messengers must be used - that is, each messenger
  must carry \textit{atleast} one invitation?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
    First, give one invitation to each of the messengers so that they are all used. Now, its a question of 
    distributing the remaining $\va - \vb = \vf$ messages amongst the $\vb$ messengers
    \begin{align}
     	N &= \eDistNAmongstM{\vf}{\vb} = \vd
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}

  \part[2] Now assume that the invitations are personalized - that is, an invitation for $A$ cannot be given to $B$. 
  In how many ways can the invitations be delivered if each messenger delivers an \textit{equal} number of 
  invitations?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  	Each messenger has to deliver $\vg$ invitations. Let the first messenger therefore pick $\vg$ from $\va$, 
  	the next $\vg$ from the remaining and so on \ldots 
  	\begin{align}
  		\ifnumequal\vb{4}{ % # messengers = 4
  			N &= \binom\va\vg \cdot \binom\vh\vg \cdot \binom\vi\vg \cdot \binom\vg\vg = \ve
  		}{
  			\ifnumequal\vb{3} { % # messengers = 3
  				N &= \binom\va\vg \cdot \binom\vh\vg \cdot \binom\vg\vg = \ve
  			}{ % number of messengers = 2
  			  N &= \binom\va\vg \cdot \binom\vh\vg = \ve
  			}
  		}
  	\end{align}
  \end{solution}
\end{parts}
