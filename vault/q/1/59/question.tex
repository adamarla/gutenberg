\question[3]  If an amount is compounded $N$ times a year at the rate of
$R\%$ in each period, then what would be the equivalent \textit{annualized}
compounding rate - $R'$?

  % stuff to be shown only in the answer key - like explanatory margin figures
  \marginnote{If you are getting 1\% a month, then why are you told you are getting 12\% per annum?}
  \marginnote[0.3cm]{Its simple. People find it easier to calculate $1\%\times 12 = 12\%$ in their
  heads than they do calculating the more precise $(1+0.01)^{12} - 1 = 12.68\%$} 
  \marginnote[0.3cm]{And so, you will most often be told the nominal rate - the 12\% - and
  not the effective rate - the 12.68\%. Its your job to find out which rate it is that 
  you are being told}

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	The point to understand is that if you started with a principal 
	amount $P$ at the beginning of the year, then
	- at the end of the year - it should make no difference to you if you got $R\%$
	 $N$ times a year or $R'\%$ once at the end of the year
	 
	 In other words
	 \begin{align}
	 	P\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{R}{100}\right)^N &= P\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{R'}{100}\right) \\
	 	\implies R' &= 100\cdot\left[ \left( 1+\dfrac{R}{100}\right)^N - 1 \right]
	 \end{align}
\end{solution}
