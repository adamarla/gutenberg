      $40\%$ students of a college reside in hostel
      and the remaining reside outside. At the
      end of the year, $50\%$ of the hostlers got
      \agrade while from outside students, only
      $30\%$ got \agrade in the examination.
      At the end of the year, a student of the
      college was chosen at random and was
      found to have gotten \agrade\newline
      
      What is the probability that the selected
      student was a hostler?

	$40\%$ of the students are hostlers. Therefore $\prob{H} = 0.4$ \newline 
	
	A student is either a hostler or is not. Hence 
	$\prob{H'} = 1-\prob{H} = 0.6$ \newline 
	
	If the student is a hostler, then there is a $50\%$ chance that he would get 
	an \agrade $\implies \condp{A}{H} = 0.5$ \newline 
	
	But if he is not a hostler, then there is a $30\%$ chance that he would get 
	an \agrade $\implies \condp{A}{H'} =0.3$ \newline 
	
	Which is why 
      \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{NlN}
        \toprule
        \text{Expression} & Meaning & \text{Value} \\
        \midrule
        \prob{H} & Is a hostler & 0.4 \\
        \midrule
        \condp{A}{H}&\agrade given hostler & 0.5 \\
        \midrule
        \condp{A}{H'} &\agrade given not hostler & 0.3 \\
        \midrule
        \prob{H'} & Not a hostler & 0.6 \\
        \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
\end{center}
But what we \underline{want to know} is the probability that a student 
is a hostler \underline{given that} he has got an \agrade, that is, 
\[ \qquad \qquad \condp{H}{A} = ? \]
      
\end{step}

\begin{step}
	\begin{options}
		\correct
		
		\[\condp{H}{A} = \fcondp{H}{A} = \frac{10}{19} \]
        
        \incorrect
        
        \[\condp{H}{A} = \fcondp{H}{A} = \frac{7}{13} \]

	\end{options}
	\reason
	
	From Bayes' Theorem, we know that 
	\begin{align}
          \condp{H}{A} &= \dfrac{\prob{H\cap A}}{\prob{A}} \\
          &= \underbrace{\fcondp{H}{A}}_{\text{Bayes' Theorem}}
        \end{align} 
        
        Where 
        \[\underbrace{\prob{A} = \condp{A}{H}\prob{H} + \condp{A}{H'}\prob{H'}}_{\text{Theorem of Total Probability}} \]
        And therefore
        \begin{align}
          \condp{H}{A} &= \dfrac{\frac{5}{10}\cdot\frac{4}{10}}
          {\frac{5}{10}\cdot\frac{4}{10} + \frac{3}{10}\cdot\frac{6}{10} } = \dfrac{10}{19}
        \end{align}
