$A$ speaks the truth in 60\% of the cases, while 
$B$ in 90\% of the cases. In what percent of cases 
are they likely to contradict each other in stating 
the same fact? In the cases of contradiction do 
you think, the statement of $B$ will carry more 
weight as he speaks truth in more number of 
cases than $A$?

  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
   \toprule
        $A$& $B$ & Contradiction? \\

By looking at the table above, we can \underline{define}  the event $C$ 
\[ \qquad C = \left(A'\cap B \right) \cup \left(A\cap B' \right)\]

And hence 
\begin{align}
P(C) &= P \left[ \left(A'\cap B \right) \cup \left(A\cap B' \right)\right] \\
&= \left[P(A')\cdot P(B) \right] + \left[P(A)\cdot P(B') \right] \\
&= \underbrace{\left(0.4\times 0.9 \right)}_{P(A') = 1-P(A)} + \underbrace{\left(0.6\times 0.1 \right)}_{P(B') = 1-P(B)} = 0.42
\end{align}

Hence, $A$ and $B$ \underline{will contradict each other} $42\%$ of the times

In case of a contradiction, $A$ is more reliable than $B$ if 
\[ \qquad \condp{A}{C} > \condp{B}{C} \]
Otherwise, $B$ is more reliable  

\newcard

In case of a contradiction, $A$ is more reliable than $B$ if 
\[ \qquad \condp{C}{A} > \condp{C}{B} \]
Otherwise, $B$ is more reliable 

\newcard 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{Nl}
   \toprule
        \text{Probability} & Of  \\
   \midrule 
   \condp{A}{C} & $A$ speaking truth given \\
   & contradiction $C$\\
    \midrule 
    \condp{C}{A} & Contradiction $C$ given $A$ \\
    & speaking the truth \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Now, if a contradiction has occurred, then what we really want to compare are the probabilities of $A$ and $B$ speaking the truth\newline 

 The one who is more likely to be speaking the truth is more reliable. Hence, we need to do the following comparison 

\[ \qquad \condp{A}{C} > \condp{B}{C} \]

\newcard

\begin{align}
	\condp{A}{C} &= \fcondp{A}{C} \\
	&= \frac{0.1\times 0.6}{0.42} = \frac{1}{7} \\
	\condp{B}{C} &= \fcondp{B}{C} \\
	&= \frac{0.4\times 0.9}{0.42} = \frac{6}{7}
\end{align}

As $\condp{B}{C} > \condp{A}{C}$, therefore $B$ is (a whole lot) more reliable than $A$ 

\newcard 

From Bayes' Theorem we know that 
\begin{align}
	\condp{A}{C} &= \fcondp{A}{C} \\
	\text{and }\condp{B}{C} &= \fcondp{B}{C} 
\end{align}

We know $P(A), P(B)$ and $P(C)$. But what are $\condp{C}{A}$ and $\condp{C}{B}$? 

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{NlN}
   \toprule
        &  What needs to happen & \text{Equals} \\
   \midrule 
   \condp{C}{A} & $B$ must lie for contradiction & P(B')\\
    \midrule 
    \condp{C}{B} & $A$ must lie for contradiction & P(A') \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

And hence, we can say that 
\begin{align}
\condp{A}{C} &= \fcondp{A}{C} \\
&= \frac{0.1\times 0.6}{0.42} =  \frac{1}{7} \\
\text{and }\condp{B}{C} &= \fcondp{B}{C}  \\
&= \frac{0.4\times 0.9}{0.42} = \frac{6}{7} 
\end{align}

As $\condp{B}{C} > \condp{A}{C}$, therefore $B$ is more reliable than $A$ in case of contradiction (and even otherwise)
