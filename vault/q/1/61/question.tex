\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\begin{align}
		P_{\texttt{3}} &= P_{\texttt{0}}\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{R}{N}\right)^{N\times T}
	\end{align}
	where,
	\begin{align}
		N &= \text{\# of compounding periods per year} = 4 \\
		R &= \text{annualized rate of interest} = 8.5\% = 0.085 \\
		T &= \text{investment period} = \text{3 years}
	\end{align}
	
	Therefore,
	\begin{align}
		P_{\texttt{3}} &= \text{\texteuro}10,000\cdot\left( 1 + \dfrac{0.085}{4}\right)^{4\times 3} \\
		               &= \text{\texteuro} 12,870.19 \\
		\implies I_{\texttt{3}} &= P_{\texttt{3}} - P_{\texttt{0}} = \text{\texteuro} 2,870.19
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
