\question[2] A committee of $\va$ persons needs to be formed from amongst $\vb$ people. However, 
Mr. X and Ms. Y do not like each other. And so, if one is picked, then the other cannot be. In how many 
ways then can the committee be formed?

\watchout[-30pt]

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	If Mr. X is picked, then Ms. Y is out of consideration $\implies$ $\ve$ out of $\vd$ 
	will remain to be picked. Same goes for if Ms. Y is picked first

  And then there are committees in which neither Mr. X \textit{nor} Ms. Y are members $\implies$ 
  $\va$ out of $\vd$ need to be picked
	
	\begin{align}
		N_{\texttt{total}} &= \overbrace{2\times\binom\vd\ve}^{\texttt{either picked}} + 
    \overbrace{\binom\vd\va}^{\texttt{neither picked}} = \vc
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
