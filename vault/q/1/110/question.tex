\question[2] A school offers just two courses to its students - French and Computer Science. 
If $\vb$\% of the students take both while $\vf$\% take just French, then what is
the probability that a randomly picked student is taking Computer Science given
that she is already taking French?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  In the Venn diagram alongside, $F$ is the set of students taking French and $C$ is 
  the set of students Computer Science.

  Now, if $P(F)$ be the probability that a student takes French, then 
  \begin{align}
    P(F) &= P(\text{only French}) + P(\text{both}) \\
         &= \vf\% + \vb\% = \vx\%
  \end{align}

  What we are looking for, however, is $P(C\vert F)$. And this is given by
  \begin{align}
    P(C\vert F) &= \dfrac{P(C\cap F)}{P(F)} = \dfrac{\vb\%}{\vx\%} = \vr\% 
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
