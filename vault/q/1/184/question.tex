\question[3] If $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the equation of the line $L_1: ax+by+c=0$ are 
\textit{consecutive odd} (or even) integers $(a<b<c)$, then prove that the line \textit{always} passes
through the point $(1,-2)$.

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  If $a$, $b$ and $c$ are consecutive odd integers, then 
  \begin{align}
    b &= \dfrac{a+c}{2}\implies a-2b + c = 0
  \end{align}

  But hold on! This is what we would get if we substituted $(x,y)=(1,-2)$ in 
  the equation of $L_1$. Hence proved.
