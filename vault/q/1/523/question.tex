\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  \textbf{Below are two ways of proving the proposition}

  \textbf{Method \#1}

  If we assume that $2^n > n^2$, then 
  \begin{align}
    2\cdot 2^n &> 2\cdot n^2 \implies 2^{n+1} > n^2 + n^2 \\
    \text{or } 2^{n+1} &> (n^2 + 2n + 1) + (n^2 - 2n - 1) \\
     &> (n+1)^2 + (n^2 - 2n - 1) 
  \end{align}

  Note now that,
    \[\text{If } a > b + c, \text{ then } a > b \text{ if } a,b,c > 0 \]

  And as $n^2 - 2n - 1 > 0$ for $n\geq 5$, therefore 
    \[ 2^{n+1} > (n+1)^2 + (n^2-2n-1) \implies 2^{n+1} > (n+1)^2 \] 

  Moreover, $2^n > n^2$ for $n=5$. Which means the proposition is also true for $n=6,7,8,\ldots\infty$.

  \textbf{Method \#2}

  If we assume that  $2^n > n^2$ for some $n\geq 5$, then for the proposition to be true
  \begin{align}
    2^{n+1} &> (n+1)^2\implies 2\cdot 2^n > (n^2 + 2n + 1) \\
    \implies 2\cdot 2^n &> n^2\cdot\left[ 1 + \frac{2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right]
  \end{align}

  Lets focus on the new term 
  \[\left[ 1+\frac{2}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2} \right]\]

  Notice that as $n$ increases, the value of this term decreases. 

  Conversely, the largest value will be for the smallest $n$. 

  The smallest $n$ we are considering is $n=5$ for which the value of 
  this term is $\dfrac\vc\vd < 2$.

  And as we are \textbf{assuming} $2^n > n^2$ and as we have \textbf{just shown}
  \[ 2 > \left[ 1 + \frac{2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right] \]
  therefore we can now say that if $2^n > n^2$ for some $n\geq 5$, then
  \[ \underbrace{2\cdot 2^n > n^2\cdot\left[ 1 + \frac{2}{n} + \frac{1}{n^2} \right]}
  _{a\cdot b > c\cdot d\text{ if } a > c\text{ and } b > d }\]
  \[\implies 2^{n+1} > (n+1)^2\]

  Hence, if the proposition is true for some $n$, then it is also true for $n+1$. 
  And for $n=5$, it is true $(2^5>5^2)\implies$ it is also true for $n=6,7,\ldots\infty$.
