Assume that the chances of a patient
having a heart attack is 40\%. Assuming
that a meditation and yoga course reduces 
the risk of a heart attack by 30\% and
prescription of certain drugs reduces its
chances by 25\%. At a time, a patient can 
choose any of the two options with equal 
probabilities. It is given that after going 
through one of the two options, a patient 
selected at random suffers a heart attack. 

Find the probability that the patient followed
a course of meditation and yoga. Interpret
the result and state which of the above
methods is beneficial for the patient.

For a patient who takes either yoga or 
the drug, the probability of having a 
heart attack is as follows.

For a patient who takes \underline{\text{neither}} of yoga or
the drug, the probability of having a heart 
attack is 40\%. 

But if he takes one of the two, the risk reduces.

\text{Yoga} &amp; 30\% &amp; (1-0.3)\cdot 40\% = 0.28 \\

In Step 1, we found the probability of a 
patient having a heart attack \underline{\text{later}} given that 
he took one of yoga or the drug \underline{\text{today}}. 

These are therefore conditional probabilities. 
And mathematically, they are written as  
$P(H\vert Y)$ and $P(H\vert D)$.

What we need to find is the probability that
the patient took Yoga \underline{\text{given that}} he
has had a heart attack. 

Once again, this is conditional probability. 
And it is expressed mathematically as $P(Y\vert H)$.

   </step>
   <step>
      <options>
         <tex correct="true">\begin{align}
	P(Y\vert H) &amp;= \dfrac{P(H\vert Y)\cdot P(Y)}{P(H)}\\
	&amp;= \dfrac{0.28\times 0.5}{0.28\times 0.5 + 0.3\times 0.5} = \frac{14}{29}
\end{align} </tex>
      </options>
      <reason>
         <tex>\begin{align}
	P(Y\vert H) &amp;= \underbrace{\dfrac{P(H\vert Y)\cdot P(Y)}{P(H)}}_{\text{Bayes' Theorem}} \\
	&amp;= \dfrac{P(H\vert Y)\cdot P(Y)}{P(H\vert Y)\cdot P(Y) + P(H\vert D)\cdot P(D)} \\
\end{align} \\
%text
Now, a patient is \underline{\text{equally likely}} to pick either
yoga or the drug. Hence, $P(Y) = P(D) = \frac{1}{2}$.
%
\begin{align}
P(Y\vert H) &amp;= \dfrac{0.28\times 0.5}{0.28\times 0.5 + 0.3\times 0.5} = \frac{14}{29}
\end{align}\\
%text
Now, notice that $\frac{14}{29}\lt 50\%$. Hence, if a 
patient has a heart attack, then it is \underline{\text{less likely}}
that he did yoga. Which means, that he is 
more likely to have taken the drug. 

\underline{\text{But still, he had a heart attack.}}

Hence, doing yoga would have reduced the
chances of a heart attack still further.
