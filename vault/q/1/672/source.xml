Examine the continuity of $f(x)$ where
$f(x)$ is defined as 

%
\qquad f(x) = \begin{cases}
			   \sin x - \cos x, x\neq 0 \\
			   -1, x = 0

\textcolor{blue}{\text{To Prove}}
$f(x)$ is continuous for all $x$ -- 
and not just $x=0$ or some 
other $x$

The question clearly asks us to 
\underline\text{examine the continuity} of $f(x)$ 

Which means, you must also think 
about whether $f(x)$ is continuous 
at $x=\pi$ or $x=-10,000$

$\sin x$ is continuous for all $x$. 
So is $\cos x$.
