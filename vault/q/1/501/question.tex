\question[2] What is the concern with serial correlation in a time series regression?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  In the context of time series regressions, the errors in the model may be serially correlated, that 
  is to say the errors in adjacent time periods are correlated. In basic time series analysis, we sometimes 
  assume (TS5) that there is no serial correlation in the errors. If this is violated then our usual methods 
  for statistical inference do not work. Note that this serial correlation in the variables is not a concern.
