\question[3]  Water is leaking from a conical funnel at the rate of \SI{5}{\cubic\centi\metre\per\second}.
If the radius of the base of the funnel is \SI{5}{\centi\meter} and the funnel's height is 
\SI{10}{\centi\meter}, find the rate at which water level is dropping when it is 
\SI{2.5}{\centi\meter} from the top. Assume that the other end of the funnel is a tip

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	From the figure alongside, we can see that if 
	$h$ be the height from the tip of the funnel to the water-level and $r$
	be the radius at the water-level, then 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{r}{h} &= \dfrac{R_0}{H} = \dfrac{5}{10} = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
		\implies r &= \dfrac{h}{2}
	\end{align}
	Also, we have been told that 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\ud V}{\ud t} &= \dfrac{\pi}{3}\dfrac{\ud}{\ud t}r^2h = \SI{5}{\cubic\centi\meter\per\second} \\
		&= \dfrac{\pi}{3}\left[2rh\dfrac{\ud r}{\ud t} + r^2\dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t}\right] \\
		&= \dfrac{\pi}{3}\left[h^2\cdot\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t} + \dfrac{h^2}{4}\dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t} \right] \\
		\implies \dfrac{\pi h^2}{4}\dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t} &= \SI{5}{\cubic\centi\meter\per\second} \\
		\implies \dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t} &= \dfrac{\SI{5}{\cubic\centi\meter\per\second}}
		{\dfrac{\pi h^2}{4}}
	\end{align}
	When the water-level is $2.5$ cm from the base, $h = 7.5$ cm. And at that instant
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{\ud h}{\ud t} &= \dfrac{\SI{5}{\cubic\centi\meter\per\second}}
		{\dfrac{\pi}{4}\cdot(\SI{7.5}{\centi\meter})^2} \\
		&= \SI{0.028}{\centi\meter\per\second}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
