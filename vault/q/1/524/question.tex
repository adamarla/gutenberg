\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  In plain English, we have to prove - or disprove - that the whole family of polynomials
  - $x-1, x^2-1, x^3-1,\ldots, (x^{100}-1),\ldots$ is divisible by $x-1$. Now,

  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{x^n-1}{x-1} &= \dfrac{x^n - x^{n-1} + x^{n-1} - 1}{x-1} \\
                       &= \dfrac{x^{n-1}\cdot (x-1) + (x^{n-1} - 1)}{x - 1} \\
                       &= x^{n-1} + \dfrac{x^{n-1} - 1}{x-1}
  \end{align}
  
  Which means, that \textbf{if} $(x^{n-1}-1)$ is divisible by $(x-1)$, \textbf{then} so is $(x^n-1)$. 
  And it is easy to see that $(x^n-1)$ is divisible by $x-1$ for $n=1$. Which means, it must 
  also be so for $n=2$ and therefore $n=3$ and so on. Hence proved.
\end{solution}
