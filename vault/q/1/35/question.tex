\question[3] The base of a bucket - formed by truncating a right circular cone - 
has a radius of 7 inches. The open end has a radius of 15 inches and the height 
of the bucket is 16 inches. What is the bucket's volume ?

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	From the top to the base, the radius falls from $15$ inches to $7$ inches 
	over a height of $16$ inches
	
	This suggests that, 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{15-7}{16} &= \dfrac{15-0}{16+h} \\
		\implies (16+h) &= 30 \text{ or } h = 14
	\end{align}
	, where $h$ is the height that was lopped off from the full cone to form the bucket
	
	The volume of the bucket is simply the volume of the full cone 
	minus the volume of the bit that was removed
	
	\begin{align}
	   V &= \dfrac{1}{3}\pi\left[ 15^2\cdot(16+h) - 7^2\cdot h\right] \\
	     &= \dfrac{6064}{3}\pi = 2021\frac{1}{3}\pi \text{ cubic inch }
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
