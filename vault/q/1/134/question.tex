\question[5] Two people started simultaneously towards each other from points $A$ and $B$ which 
are $\vd$ km apart. They met $\vt$ hours later. After their meeting, the first person, who travelled 
from $A$ to $B$ decreased his speed by 1 km/h on the way back. The second person, 
on the other hand, increased his speed by 1 km/h on the way back. The first person 
is known to arrive back at $A$ two(2) hours \textbf{after} the second person arrives back at $B$. What is 
the \textbf{first person's initial speed?}

\watchout

\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
	If $s_1$ and $s_2$ be the speeds of the first and second person respectively and they
	meet at some point $X$ in the middle, then 
	
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{AX}{s_1} &= \dfrac{BX}{s_2} = \vt\text{ hours} \\
		\implies AX &= \vt\cdot s_1 \\
		\text{and, } \dfrac{\overbrace{\vd-AX}^{BX}}{s_2} = \dfrac{\vd-\vt\cdot s_1}{s_2} &= \vt \implies s_1 + s_2 = \va
	\end{align}
	
	On the way back, 
	\begin{align}
		\dfrac{AX}{s_1 - 1} - \dfrac{BX}{s_2 + 1} &= 2\text{ hours} \\
		\implies \dfrac{\vt s_1}{s_1 - 1} - \dfrac{\vd - \vt s_1}{s_2 + 1} &= 2 \\
		\implies \dfrac{\vt s_1}{s_1 - 1} - \dfrac{\vd - \vt s_1}{\va-s_1+1} &= 2 \\
    \implies 2s_1^2 + \vj s_1 + \vk &= 0 \\
    \implies 2\cdot(s_1 - \vs)^2 &= 0\implies s_1 = \vs\text{ km/h}
	\end{align}
	
\end{solution}
