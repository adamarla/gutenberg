A pair of dice is thrown 4 times. If getting a 
doublet is considered a success, then find
the probability distribution of successes.

\textbf{Getting a doublet}
The figure below shows the two dice after 
being thrown. If you can see only one die, 
then what is the \underline\text{probability you got a doublet}?

\textbf{Probability of getting 2 doublets}
Shown below is \underline\text{one way} of getting two 
doublets in 4 rounds of throwing. But in which 
of the two figures  has the probability of 
getting two doublets been written correctly?

Think of it like this. You roll the two dice. 
But you see the number on Dice I before 
you see the number on Dice II. 

Dice I will have some number (1-6) on it. 

But to get a doublet, Dice II must also have 
the same number.

Which means the probability of getting a 
doublet is $=p = \frac{1}{6}$

The probability of getting doublets in 
\underline\text{exactly rounds \#2 and \#4} is 
\[\qquad \quad p^2\cdot q^2 \text{ where } q = (1-p)  \]

\underline\text{But we want two doublets total} - not 
just in rounds 2 and 4. Which means that 
we are ok with getting the doublets in 
rounds (1,2) or (1,3) or (1,4) etc.

Hence, the \underline\text{total probability} would be 
\[ \qquad \quad ^4C_2\cdot p^2\cdot q^2 \]

In Step 2, we learned how to find the 
\underline\text{probability of getting 2 doublets}. 

But the \underline\text{probability of getting R doublets}
$(R\leq 4)$ is simply 

\[ \qquad \qquad P(R) = ^4C_R \cdot p^R \cdot q^{4-R} \] 

Note that $q = 1-p = \frac{5}{6}$ in the above equation. 

And hence, the \underline\text{probability distribution} 
will be as follows

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
\text{\# of doublets} &amp; \text{Prob. Expr.} &amp; \text{Probability} \\

0 &amp; ^4C_0\cdot p^0\cdot q^4 &amp; \frac{625}{1296} \\
