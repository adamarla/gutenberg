Commander Spock of Star Trek fame would 
like to invest some money for a period of 2
\underline\text{Vulcan years} (1 Vulcan year = 2 Earth years)

He can choose one of two banks - Bank E on 
planet Earth or Bank V on planet Vulcan.

Bank E offers $3\%$ compound interest every
\underline\text{6 Earth months} while Bank V offers $6\%$ 
compound interest \underline\text{once every Vulcan year}.
Which bank should Spock choose to get 
greater returns?

      <tex>\\ %text
Over a period of \underline\text{2 Vulcan years}, how many
times will the money compound in the 
two banks (Bank E and Bank V) ?

      <tex>\\ %text
Given the number of compounding periods, 
which bank will give the \underline\text{larger final amount}
at the end of 2 Vulcan years? 
\textbf{Use: } $(1.03)^4 = 1.13, (1.06)^2=1.124$

\underline\text{2 Vulcan years = 4 Earth years} 

As Bank E compounds money \underline\text{twice} every 
\underline\text{Earth year} (once every 6 Earth months),
therefore over 4 Earth years, it would have 
compounded the money $=4\times 2 = 8$ times. 

Similarly, Bank V compounds money \underline\text{once} 
every \underline\text{1 Vulcan year}. 

Therefore, over 2 Vulcan years, it would 
compound the money $=2\times 1 = 2$ times.

If Spock puts in Rs. P initially (the principal), 
then at the \underline\text{end of 2 vulcan years}, he would
get the following \underline\text{final amounts}.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
&amp;  \text{Interest} &amp; \text{Final amount} &amp; \text{Equals} \\
\hline 
\text{Bank E} &amp; 3\% &amp; \underbrace{P\cdot\left( 1 + \frac{3}{100}\right)^8}_{(1.03)^8 = (1.03^4)^2 = (1.13)^2} &amp; 1.28P \\
\hline 
\text{Bank V}  &amp; 6\% &amp; P\cdot\left( 1+\frac{6}{100}\right)^2 &amp; 1.124P \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It is obvious that Spock's money will grow 
more on Earth. And hence, he should invest 
his money with \underline\text{Bank E}.
