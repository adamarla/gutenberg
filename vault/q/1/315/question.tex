\question[2] A bag contains $2n+1$ coins. It is known that $n$ of these coins have a head on 
both sides whereas the rest of the coins are fair. A coin is picked up at random 
from the bag and tossed. If the probability that the toss results in a head is $\frac\va\vb$, 
then determine the value of $n$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  IF $H$ be the event that head results after tossing a coin randomly picked 
  from the bag, then 
  \begin{align}
    P(H) &= \underbrace{\dfrac{n}{2n+1}\times 1}_{\text{heads from an unfair coin}} 
            + \underbrace{\dfrac{n+1}{2n+1}\times\dfrac{1}{2}}_{\text{heads from a fair coin}}
            = \dfrac\va\vb \\
          &\implies \m n + \k = \n n + \va \text{ or } n = \j
  \end{align} 
\end{solution}
