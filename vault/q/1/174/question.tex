\question[4] If $\cos^{-1} x + \cos^{-1} y + \cos^{-1} z = 3\pi$, then what is the value 
of $(x+y+z)^\va$?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
	\textit{By definition}, $\cos^{-1} A \in [0,\pi]$ where $A \in [-1,1]$. Which means, 
	that the maximum value of $\cos^{-1} A$ is $\pi$
	
	So, if you have got 3 terms adding up to 3 times the maximum value of an individual term, 
	then each term \textit{must also be} at its maximum value. 
  
  Otherwise, one or more terms will have to be greater than the maximum value (not possible) 
  to compensate for a value that is less than the maximum.

  Which means, 
  \[ \cos^{-1} x = \cos^{-1}y = \cos^{-1}z = \pi \implies x = y = z = -1 \]

  And hence
    \[ (x+y+z)^\va = (-3)^\va = \vb \]
\end{solution}
