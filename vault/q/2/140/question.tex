\question[3] Three terms of a series are in arithmetic progression. If $8$ is added to the first term, the three terms now form a geometric progression, whose sum is $26$. Find the terms?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the terms of the series be $a-d$, $a$ and $a+d$. \\
  Using the condition that if $8$ is added to the first term it forms a geometric progression whose sum is $26$ we get,
  \begin{align}
    (a-d+8) + a + (a+d) &= 26 \\
    3a + 8              &= 26 \\
    a                   &= 6
  \end{align}  
  Using the condition that the three terms are in geometric progression,
  \begin{align}
    (a-d+8)(a+d) &= a^2 \\
    (14-d)(6+d)  &= 36 \\
    d = 12, -4
  \end{align} 
  There are two sets of series that satisfy the given conditions. With a common difference of $12$ the progression is ${-6,6,18}$, whereas with a common difference of $-4$, the progression is ${10, 6, 2}$.
