\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  The sum of the terms of an infinitely decreasing geometric progression starting with $a$ and having common ratio $r$ is given by,
  \begin{align}
	S = \dfrac{a}{1-r}
  \end{align}
  In our case initial term is $1$ and common ratio is $r$ therefore,
  \begin{align}
                S &= \dfrac{1}{1-r} \\
    \Rightarrow r &= 1-\dfrac{1}{S}
  \end{align}
  The progression of squares of the original geometric progression will effectively have common ration $r^2$. Therefore sum of progression of squares $S_{sq}$ is given by,
  \begin{align}
	S_{sq} &= \dfrac{1}{1-r^2} \\
		   &= \dfrac{1}{1-(1-\dfrac{1}{S})^2} \\
	       &= \dfrac{S^2}{2S-1}
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
