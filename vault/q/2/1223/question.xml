Show that $f:\mathbf{N}\rightarrow\mathbf{N},$ given by
%
  f(x)=\begin{cases}
    x+1, \text{ if $x$ is odd} \\
    x-1, \text{ if $x$ is even}

If $f(x)$ is a one-one function and $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$,
what can be said about $x_1$ and $x_2$?	
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>x_1=x_2</tex>
    <tex>x_1\neq x_2</tex>
    <reason>%text
A function $f:X\rightarrow X$ is defined as one-one
(or injective) if for every $x_1, x_2 \in X$, 
$f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ implies $x_1=x_2$.
For e.g. consider function $f(x)=x$. It is 
immediately obvious that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$
implies $x_1=x_2$. Hence, $f(x)=x$ is one-one.

    <context>f:\mathbf{N}\rightarrow\mathbf{N}, \text{ given by,} \\
f(x)=\begin{cases}
  x+1, \text{ if $x$ is odd} \\
  x-1, \text{ if $x$ is even} 
\end{cases} \\
%text
If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ is it possible that $x_1$ is odd and 
$x_2$ is even, or $x_2$ is odd and $x_1$ is even?
%
</context>
    <tex>%text
If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ it must be that either $x_1$ is odd 
and $x_2$ is even or that $x_2$ is odd and $x_1$ is even.
%
</tex>
    <reason>%text
If $x_1$ is odd and $x_2$ is even, and $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$
as per the function definition,
%
\begin{align}
  &amp; x_1+1=x_2-1 \\
  \implies &amp; x_2-x_1=2
\end{align} \\
%text
The difference betwen an odd and even number
cannot be $2$. Therefore the assumption that
for $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be even
and odd, or odd and even is incorrect. 
%</reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>%text
For the same function as defined in the prior
step, if $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ and $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both
even, what is the relation between $x_1$ and $x_2$?
%
</context>
    <tex>x_2-x_1=2</tex>
    <reason>%text
If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both even, and $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$
as per the function definition,
%
\begin{align}
  &amp; x_1+1=x_2+1 \\
  \implies &amp; x_2-x_1=0\implies x_1=x_2
\end{align} \\
%text
Similarly if $x_1$ and $x_2$ were both even, we would
get the same result. Therefore, it is safe to
conclude that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)\implies x_1=x_2$ and
the function $f(x)$ is one-one (or injective).

For the function $f$ defined in Step 2, for
any odd number $2n+1$ is there an $x\in\mathbf{N}$ 
such that $f(x)=2n+1$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
Yes, for any odd number $2n+1$ there 
exists an (even number) $x\in \mathbf{N}$ such that 
$f(x)=2n+1$
%</tex>
    <reason>%text
For $f(x)$ to be an odd number $2n+1$, it
must be defined as $x-1$, therefore,
%
\begin{align}
  &amp;x-1 = 2n+1 \\
  \implies &amp;x=2n+2
\end{align} \\
%text
Similarly for every even number $2n$ 
there exists an odd number $x=2n+1$ 
such that $f(x)=2n$. Therefore $f$ is also 
onto (or bijective) since its range covers 
the entire set $\mathbf{N}$.
