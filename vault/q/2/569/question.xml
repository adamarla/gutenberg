  <statement>
    <tex>\text{A factory manufactures two types of screws, A and B. Each}\\
\text{type of screw requires the use of two machines, an automatic}\\
\text{and a hand operated. It takes 4 minutes on the automatic and}\\
\text{6 minutes on the hand operated machine to manufacture a}\\
\text{package of screws A, while it takes 6 minutes on the automatic}\\
\text{3 minutes on the hand operated machine to manufacture a}\\
\text{package of screws B, Each machine is available for at the most}\\
\text{4 hours on any day. The manufacturer can sell a package of}\\
\text{screws A at a profit of Rs. 7 and screws B at a profit of Rs. 10.}\\
\text{Assuming that he can sell the screws he manufactures, how}\\
\text{many packages of each type should the factory owner produce}\\
\text{in a day in order to maximise his profit? Determine the maximum}\\
