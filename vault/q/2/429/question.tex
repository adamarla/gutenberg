\question[3] $\va$ students $\vb$ are to be randomly assigned to 
$\vc$ desks placed in a row. $B$ has a secret crush on $C$. 
What is the probability $P_{sad}$, that they do $NOT$ get to sit 
next to each other?


\watchout

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  To find the likelihood of $B$ not getting to sit next to $C$, simply
  find the probability $P_{happy}$ that they do get to sit next to each 
  other, and then find it's complement.\\
  If $N$ be the number of ways they get to sit next to each other then, 
  \begin{align}
    N &= N_1\times N_2\times N_3 \\
      &= \n\times 2\times \r! 
  \end{align}
  $N_1$ = \textit{{no. of sets of adjacent desks for B and C}} \\
  $N_2$ = \textit{{no. of ways B and C can be arranged on two desks}} \\
  $N_3$ = \textit{{no. of ways the rest can sit on remaining desks}} \\
  
  If universal set $U$, is the number of ways $\vc$ people can be 
  arranged on $\vd$ desks, then,
  \begin{align}
    P_{happy} &= \dfrac{N}{U} \\
              &= \dfrac{\n\times 2\times \r!}{\vd!} \\
              &= \dfrac{2}{\vd}
  \end{align}
  \begin{align}
    P_{sad} &= 1 - P_{happy} \\
            &= \dfrac{\r}{\vd}
  \end{align}
  
\end{solution}

  $P_{happy} = \frac{2}{\vd}$, $P_{sad} = \frac{\r}{\vd}$
