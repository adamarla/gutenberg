\question The derivative of a function $f$ is defined by 
\begin{align}
  f'(x) = \left\{
            \begin{array}{l l l}
              g(x)           & \text{for} & -4 \leq x \leq 0 \\
              5 e^{-(x/3)}-3 & \text{for} & 0 \leq x \leq 4  \\
            \end{array} 
          \right. \nonumber 
\end{align}
The graph of the continuous function $f'$, shown in figure alongside, has an x-intercepts at $x=-2$ and $x=3\ln (\dfrac{5}{3})$. The graph of $g$ on $-4 \leq x \leq 0$ is a semicircle, and $f(0)=5$.

  \part[3] For $-4 < x < 4$, find all values of $x$ at which the graph of $f$ has a point of inflection. Justify your answer.
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    A point of inflection is when the slope of a function changes behavior. It goes either from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing. In this case by looking at the graph of slope $f'(x)$, we can tell that it is decreasing till $x=-2$ and then starts increasing and continues to increase till $x=0$ at which point it starts decreasing again. Therefore the two points of inflection are $x=-2$ and $x=0$.
  \end{solution}

  \part[3] Find $f(-4)$ and $f(4)$.
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    Area under the curve of the derivative of a function represents the change in value of the original function over a given interval. In other words for any function $f(x)$,
    \begin{align}
      \int_a^b f'(x)\ud x = f(b) - f(a)
    \end{align}
    Consider the portion of the curve from $-4$ to $0$, 
    \begin{align}
       \int_{-4}^0 g(x)\ud x &= f(0) - f(-4) \\
       8-\dfrac{\pi 4}{2}    &= 5 - f(-4) \\
       f(-4)                 &= 2\pi - 3
    \end{align}
    Consider the portion of the curve from $0$ to $-4$, 
    \begin{align}
       \int_{0}^{4} (5 e^{-(x/3)}-3)\ud x   &= f(4) - f(0) \\
       \left[5(-3)e^{-(x/3)}-3x \right]_0^4 &= f(4) - f(0) \\
       f(4)                                 &= 8 - 15 e^{(-4/3)}
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}

  \part[3] For $-4 \leq x \leq 4$, find the value of $x$ at which $f$ has an absolute maximum. Justify your answer.
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    $f'(x)$ is decreasing but positive from $x=-4$ to $x=-2$. Thereafter it starts increasing and keeps increasing till $x=0$. After this the slope remains positive till $x=\ln(5/3)$ after which it becomes negative. This means that $f(x)$ is steadily increasing from $x=-4$ till $x=\ln (3/2)$ and only then does it start decreasing. Therefore the absolute maxima of the function in the given range is at $x=\ln(3/2)$.
  \end{solution}
