A cylindrical roller $2.5$ m in length, $0.75$ m in
radius, when rolled on a road was found to 
have covered an area of $525\pi$ $m^2$. How
many revolutions did the roller make?

How much area does a roller of length $2.5$ m
and radius $0.75$ m cover in $1$ revolution?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>2.625\pi\,m^2</tex>
    <tex>1.40625\pi\, m^2</tex>
    <reason>%text
A cyclindrical roller will cover an area 
equivalent to its curved surface in one 
rotation. For a cylinder of radius $r$ and 
length $l$, the curved surface area is ${\bf 2\pi rl}$
In the given problem, 
%
2\pi rl=2\pi \times 0.75\times 2.5=2.625\pi\, m^2

If a roller covers $2.625\pi\,m^2$ in 1 revolution,
how many revolutions would it take to cover 
$525\pi\, m^2$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>200</tex>
    <tex>250</tex>
    <reason>%text
To ascertain the number of revolutions simply
divide the total area covered by the area
covered in a single revolution. In our particular
problem,
%
\text{Revolutions}=\dfrac{525\pi\, m^2}{2.625\pi\,m^2}=200 \\
%text
Note: Number of revolutions is obviously a
dimensionless entity, so no units.
