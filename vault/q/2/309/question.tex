\question[4] In how many ways can $\vn$ \textbf{distinct} items be distributed 
equally amongst three people? You can leave your answer as an expression if 
the calculations get too long.

\watchout

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Each of the three people should get $\dfrac\vn{3}=\vp$ items. 

  \textbf{Step \#1: Number of ways of creating three sets of $\vp$ items each}

  Irrespective of which person gets which items, we would first create three sets 
  of $\vp$ items each. 

  The first set will be made by picking $\vp$ items from $\vn$, the second by picking $\vp$ from 
  the remaining $\vq$ and the last will just have whatever remains. 
  \[ N_{\text{sets}} = \underbrace{\binom\vn\vp}_{\text{Set 1}}\times
  \underbrace{\binom\vq\vp}_{\text{Set 2}}\times
  \underbrace{\binom\vr\vp}_{\text{Set 3}} \]
  \textbf{Step \#2: Number of ways of distributing three sets amongst three people} 

  With the sets made, we can think about whom to give them to. 

  The first person could get either of the three. The second, one of the remaining two. 
  And the last person will just have to take whatever remains. 

  In other words, 
  \[ N_{\text{distribute}} = 3\times 2\times 1 = 3! = 6 \] 

  Hence, the \textbf{required} number of ways is simply 
  \begin{align}
    N_{\text{reqd}} &= N_{\text{sets}}\times N_{\text{distribute}} \\
        &= \binom\vn\vp\times\underbrace{\binom\vq\vp\times\binom\vr\vp\times 3!}_{=\vz} \\
        &= \vz\times\binom\vn\vp
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
