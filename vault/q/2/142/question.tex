\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
  Let the progression have initial term $a$ and common ration $r$. From the question statement we know that,
  \begin{align}
    a+ar+ar^2   &= 3 \\
    a+ar^2+ar^4 &= \dfrac{21}{4}
  \end{align}
  Rewrite equation (2) as follows,
  \begin{align}
    a(1+r^2+r^4)               &= \dfrac{21}{4} \\
	a((1+r+r^2)^2-2r(1+r+r^2)) &= \dfrac{21}{4}
  \end{align}
  Using equation (1) and (4)
  \begin{align}
    a((\dfrac{3}{a})^2-2r(\dfrac{3}{a}) &= \dfrac{21}{4} \\
    \dfrac{3}{a}-2r                     &= \dfrac{7}{4} \\
    r(1+r+r^2-2r)                       &= 7 \\
    r                                   &= -\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{3}{2}
  \end{align}
  Common ratio $\dfrac{3}{2}$ is rejected as it will not result in a converging series. Substituting common ratio $-\dfrac{1}{2}$ in equation (1), we get initial term as $\dfrac{8}{3}$.
