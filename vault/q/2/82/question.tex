\question[3]  ABC Bank is offering to double your money in no time! They say that if you invest
with them, then they will compound your money by 6\% \emph{every} quarter. But their 
advertisement fails to mention how long it would actually take to double the money. So, 
how long would it actually take?

  will take longer than 3.76 years to double your money}
  \marginnote[0.3cm]{This offer, therefore, sounds too good to be true. And if 
  it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true}

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  If it takes $N$ years to double an initial amount $P$, then it follows that

	\begin{align}
			2P &= P\left(1+\dfrac{6}{100}\right)^{\texttt{4 times per year}\times N\texttt {years}} \\
		 	 \Rightarrow 2 &= \left(\dfrac{106}{100}\right)^\text{4N} \\
		\Rightarrow \log 2 &= 4N\cdot\left(\log 106 - \log 100\right) \\
		\Rightarrow	N &= \dfrac{\log 2}{4\cdot\left(\log 106 - \log 100\right)} \\
		\Rightarrow N &= 3.76\text{ years}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
