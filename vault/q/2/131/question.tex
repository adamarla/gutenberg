\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the progression have a common difference $d$. The seventh term is denoted as $a_7$.
  \begin{align}
    a_7 &= 2 + (7-1)d \\
    20  &= 2 + 6d \\
    d   &= 3 
  \end{align}
  Now that we know the common difference, let us go ahead and calculate the sum of 20 terms using the general formula for summation of an arithmetic progression,
  \begin{align}
    S_n    &= \dfrac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d) \\
    S_{20} &= \dfrac{20}{2}(2(2) + (20-1)3) \\
           &= 610
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
