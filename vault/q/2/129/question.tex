\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the numbers be $\dfrac{a}{r}$, $a$ and $ar$. The equations we have are
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar           &= 35 \\
    (\dfrac{a}{r})^2 + a^2 + (ar)^2 &= 525 \\
  \end{align}
  We can rewrite equation (2) as follows,
  \begin{align}
    (\dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar)^2 - 2a(\dfrac{a}{r} + r + ar) &= 525 \\
    35^2 - 2a(35)                                         &= 525 \\
    a                                                     &= 10
  \end{align}
    

\end{solution}
