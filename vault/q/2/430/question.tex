\question[2] In a large metropolitan area the probabilities that a family 
(randomly chosen for a sample survey) owns a car, a motorcycle or both
kinds of vehicles are $\va$, $\vb$ and $\vc$. What is the
probability that a family owns a vehicle of any sort assuming the only
kinds of vehicles are cars and motorcycles.


\watchout

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $P_{car}$    &- Probability a family owns a car \\
    $P_{mcycle}$ &- Probability a family owns a motorcycle \\
    $P_{both}$   &- Probability a family owns both a car and a motorcycle\\
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{align}
    P_{any} &= P_{car} + P{mcycle} - P_{both} \\
            &= \va +\vb - \vc \\
            &= \s
  \end{align}
  There is a $\s$ probability that a family has at least one vehicle.
	
\end{solution}
