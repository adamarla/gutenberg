\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the terms of the series of $\dfrac{a}{r}$, $a$ and $ar$. Based on the conditions specified in the question we can construct the following equations,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{a}{r} + a + ar           &= 35 \\
    (\dfrac{a}{r})^2 + a^2 + (ar)^2 &= 525
  \end{align}
  We can re-write equation (2) from above as follows,
  \begin{align}
    a^2(\dfrac{1}{r^2} + 1 + r^2)                            &= 525 \\
    a^2((\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r)^2 - 2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r))  &= 525 \\
    (a(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r))^2 - 2a^2(\dfrac{1}{r} + 1 + r) &= 525
  \end{align}  
  Using the result from equation (1) in equation (5),
  \begin{align}
    35^2 - 2a(35) &= 525 \\
    a             &= 10
  \end{align}
  Replacing this result in equation (1), we get the common ratio as $2$ (or $\dfrac{1}{2}$) and the terms of the series as $5$, $10$ and $20$.
