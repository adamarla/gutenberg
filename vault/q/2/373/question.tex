\question One urn contains two $Black$ balls (labelled $B_1$ and $B_2$) and a
$White$ ball (labelled $W$). A second urn contains two $White$ balls (labelled
$W_1$ and $W_2$) and a $Black$ ball (labelled $B$). One of the urns is chosen
at random and a ball is picked from it. Then without replacing that ball
another ball is picked from the same urn.

\begin{parts}
  \part[2] Write the sample space showing all possible outcomes. \\
  \textit{Note: ($B_1$, $B_2$) and ($B_2$, $B_1$) are distinct outcomes}

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
    Sample space of solutions:
    \begin{align}
      S=\{B_1B_2,B_1W,B_2B_1,B_2W,WB_1,WB_2,\nonumber\\
        W_1W_2,W_1B,W_2W_1,W_2B,BW_1,BW_2i\}\nonumber
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[1] What is the probability that two $Black$ balls are chosen?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
    \begin{align}
      P_{2Black} = \dfrac{2}{12} = \dfrac{1}{6} \nonumber
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}
  
  \part[1] What is the probability that two balls of opposite color are chosen?

\begin{solution}[\mcq]
    \begin{align}
      P_{Opp} = \dfrac{8}{12} = \dfrac{2}{3} \nonumber
    \end{align}
  \end{solution}
