\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  One way to think about the problem is, let Alice and Bob together be effectively one person(Alice-Bob or Bob-Alice). \\
  Now, number of ways we can arrange $7$ people in a circle = $6!$ \\
  Number of ways Alice and Bob can sit next to each other = $2$. \\
  Therefore number of ways the group can be arranged is given by, 
  \begin{align}
    \text{No. of ways} &= 6!\times 2 \nonumber \\
                       &= 1440 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  
  Another way to think about the problem is, fix Alice's spot on the circle. \\
  Number of spots available for Bob = $2$ \\
  Number of spots available for the others = $6!$ \\
  Again total number of ways the group can be arranged is $6!\times2$ which is $1440$    
  
\end{solution}
