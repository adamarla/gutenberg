\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Let the three numbers be $\dfrac{a}{r}$, $a$ and $ar$, where $a$ is the middle term and $r$ is the common ratio. From the condition regarding the product of the numbers we can gather that,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{a}{r}\times a \times{ar} &= 64 \\
    a                               &= 4
  \end{align}
  Using this result in the arithmetic mean condition we get,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{\dfrac{4}{r}+4+4r}{3} &= \dfrac{14}{3} \\
    4r^2-10r+4                   &= 0 \\
    r                            &= 2,\dfrac{1}{2}
  \end{align}
  The geometric progression is ${2,4,8}$ or ${8,4,2}$ depending on which value of common ratio is picked.
\end{solution}
