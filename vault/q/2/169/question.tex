\begin{solution}[\mcq]
  Since presents are identical and each child must get at least one $6$ out of the $10$ presents can only be distributed in one way. \\
  To distribute the remaining $4$ identical presents among $6$ children, let the $6$ children be represented as $6-1=5$ partitions. We can count the number of arrangements of $4$ identical objects (presents) among $5$ partitions by doing,
  \begin{align}
    N &= \dfrac{(4+5)!}{4!5!} \nonumber \\
      &= 126  \nonumber
  \end{align}
  Thus, the presents can be distributed in $126$ different ways.
\end{solution}
