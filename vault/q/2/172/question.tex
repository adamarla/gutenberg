\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Total number of all $3$ member committees that can be chosen from a group of $10$
  \begin{align}
    N_{total} = C^{10}_3 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  Total number of $3$ member male only committees that can be chosen is
  \begin{align}
    N_{male} = C^{5}_3 \nonumber
  \end{align}
  By symmetry, same is the case for number of female only committees $N_{female}$.
  
  Therefore number of mixed gender committees is,
  \begin{align}
    N_{mixed} &= N_{total} - (N_{male}+N_{female}) \nonumber \\
              &= C^{10}_3 - 2(C^5_3) \nonumber \\
              &= 120 \nonumber
  \end{align}
\end{solution}
