\question[3] A train was delayed by a semaphore for $\va min$. It made up for
the delay along a section of $\vb km$ length, traveling $\vc km/h$ higher than 
its scheduled speed. Find the scheduled speed $v(km/h)$ of the train. \textit{A 
semaphore allows a train to enter a critical section of track where only one train
can go at a time. (speed = distance/time)}.

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Since the train made up for the delay, we can equate the time it would have 
  taken if it traveled as per schedule with the time it actually took.
  \begin{align}
    T_{scheduled}            &= T_{delay} + T_{catch up} \\
    \dfrac{\vb(km)}{v(km/h)} &= \dfrac{\va(min)}{60(min/h)}
                                +\dfrac{\vb(km)}{v+\vc(km/h)} \\
    &\implies \dfrac{\p}{v} = \dfrac{1}{60}+\dfrac{\p}{v+\vc} \\
    &\implies v^2 + \vc v - \q = 0 \\
    &\implies v = \vd,-\r
  \end{align}
  Rejecting the negative value, the scheduled normal speed of the train is $\vd km/h$.
\end{solution}
