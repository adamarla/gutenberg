\question[6] In how many ways can the six faces of a cube be numbered - using 1 through 6 
so that no two cubes that have been numbered differently look the same in any orientation?
\texttt{Hint:} Unroll the cube and lay its faces flat out on a table

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  There are two ways to go about this problem.\\
  First method:\\
  Let us fix a point of reference on the cube by numbering the \textbf{top}
  face $1$. Now, we can number all of the other faces with reference to it.
  The bottom face can be numbered in,
  \begin{align}
     N_{bottom} = 6 - 1 = 5 \textit{ ways}
  \end{align}
  The four side faces are in a closed loop. The number of ways in which
  $n$ distinct objects can be arranged in a closed loop is $(n-1)!$, 
  therefore the side faces can be numbered in,
  \begin{align}
     N_{sides} = (4 - 1) = 3! = 6 \textit{ ways}
  \end{align}
  Therefore the total unique ways to number the cube are,
  \begin{align}
    N_{unique} &= N_{bottom} \times N_{sides} \\
               &= 5 \times 3! = 30 
  \end{align}
  \\
  Second method:\\
  The maximum ways in which six unique numbers can be assigned to six
  places (or sides of a cube) is,
  \begin{align}
    N_{maximum} = 6! 
  \end{align}
  However this includes patterns which really are the same cube, just
  oriented differently. The number of such orientations possible for 
  a given six sided cube numbered $1$ through $6$ is,
  \begin{align}
  N_{orientations} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \quad\text{(4 with each digit as base)}
  \end{align}
  By factoring out the number of orientations of the same cube from the 
  \textit{maximum} number we get,
  \begin{align}
    N_{unique} &= \dfrac{N_{maximum}}{N_{orientations}} \\
               &= \dfrac{6!}{24} = 30 \textit{ ways}
  \end{align}   
\end{solution}
