\question[3]  Suppose I want to have \texteuro{60,000} in my account for my children's college education. 
I expect to earn interest at an \textit{annualized} rate of 12\% compounded $4$ times an year. 
If I deposit \texteuro{25,000} in my account today, how many years will it take me to meet my goal 
( \texteuro{60,000} in my account)?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  If it will take $N$ years to get from \texteuro{25,000} (today) to \texteuro{60,000} (eventually), then 
	\begin{align}
    \text{\texteuro{60,000}} &= \text{\texteuro{25,000}}\times
    \underbrace{\left( 1 + \dfrac{\frac{12}{4}}{100} \right)^{4\text{ times a year}\times N\text{ year}}}
    _{\texttt{3\% compounding every quarter}}\\
    \Rightarrow \log \dfrac{60,000}{25,000} &= 4N\cdot\log 1.03 \\
    \Rightarrow N &= \dfrac{\log 2.4}{4\cdot\log 1.03} = 7.404\text{ years}
	\end{align}
\end{solution}
