\begin{solution}[\fullpage]
  The sum of terms of an infinite converging geometric series with first term $a$ and common ration $r$ is given by,
  \begin{align}
    S &= \dfrac{a}{1-r}
  \end{align}
  Sum of squares of the same series would be,
  \begin{align}
    S_{sq} &= \dfrac{a^2}{1-r^2}
  \end{align}
  Substituting the given data in the above results we get,
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{3}{2} &= \dfrac{a}{1-r} \\
    \dfrac{1}{8} &= \dfrac{a^2}{1-r^2}
  \end{align}  
  Take square on both sides of equation (3) and divide by equation (4),
  \begin{align}
    \dfrac{72}{4} &= \dfrac{a^2}{(1-r)^2}\dfrac{1-r^2}{a^2} \\
    18            &= \dfrac{1+r}{1-r} \\
    r             &=1,\dfrac{17}{19}
  \end{align}
  Ignoring result $r=1$ we get common ratio $r=\dfrac{17}{19}$ and initial term $a=\dfrac{3}{19}$.

\end{solution}
