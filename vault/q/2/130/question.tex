\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  Given $a_1 = 4$ and $a_6 = 40$, we need to find $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ and $a_5$. Now,
  \begin{align}
     a_6 &= a_1 + (6-1)\cdot d \\
     \text{or } 40 &= 4 + 5d \Rightarrow d = 7.2
  \end{align}
  And therefore, 
  \begin{align}
     a_2 &= 4 + 7.2 = 11.2 \\
     a_3 &= 4 + (3-1)\cdot 7.2 = 18.4 \\
     a_4 &= 4 + (4-1)\cdot 7.2 = 25.6 \\
     a_5 &= 4 + (5-1)\cdot 7.2 = 32.8
  \end{align}

\end{solution}
