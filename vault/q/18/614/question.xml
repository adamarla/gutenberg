    <context>\text{Is the following analysis correct}</context>
    <tex correct='true'>f(c) = \frac{1}{c-5}\\               
\lim_{x\to c}f(x) =\lim_{x\to c}\frac{1}{x-5} =\frac{1}{c-5}\\            
\text{Where c is any real number.}\\
\therefore \text{f(x) is continuous at x=c}</tex>
    <tex></tex>
    <reason>\text{Since the value of f(x) at x=c is equal }\\
\text{to the limit of f(x) at x=c.}\\
\text{Hence,f(x) is continuous for all real numbers.}</reason>
