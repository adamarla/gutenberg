% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

  \part[3] Find the volume of the solid generated when $R$ is revolved about the horizontal line $y=8$.
  \insertQR{QRC}
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    The required volume is the sum of volumes of many \textit{infinitesimally} thin rings, where
    the volume of an individual ring is given by
    \begin{align}
      \ud V(x) &= \pi\cdot\left\lbrace (8 - 4\ln (3-x))^2 - (8-6)^2 \right\rbrace  \\
              &= \pi\cdot\left\lbrace (8-4\ln (3-x))^2 - 4\right\rbrace
    \end{align}
    And so, 
    \begin{align}
      V &= \pi\cdot\int_0^2\left\lbrace (8-4\ln (3-x))^2 - 4\right\rbrace \ud x \\
        &= 168.179

  \part[3] The region $R$ is the base of a solid. For this solid, each cross section perpendicular 
  to the $x-axis$ is a square. Find the volume of the solid.
  \insertQR{QRC}
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
    The said solid is made by lining up squares with sides $= 6-4\cdot\ln(3-x)$ from left-to-right.
    And therefore, the required volume - $V$ - equal to
    \begin{align}
      V &= \int_0^2\underbrace{(6 - 4\cdot\ln(3-x))^2}_{\texttt{cross-section}}\underbrace{\ud x}_{\texttt{width}} \\
       &= 26.266
