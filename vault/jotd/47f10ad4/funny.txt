A private school was recently faced with a unique problem.  
A number of 12-year-old girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom.  
That was fine, but after they put on their lip stick, they would press their lips to the mirror 
leaving dozens of little lip prints.  Every night the maintenance man would remove them, 
and the next day the girls would put them back.  Finally the principal decided that something 
had to be done.  She called all the girls to the bathroom and met them there with the 
maintenance man.  She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for 
the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night.  To demonstrate how difficult it had 
been to clean the mirrors, she asked the maintenance man to show the girls how much effort 
was required.  He took out a long-handled squeegee, dipped it in the toilet, and cleaned the 
mirror with it.  Since then, there have been no lip prints on the mirror.  
There are teachers... and then there are educators.
