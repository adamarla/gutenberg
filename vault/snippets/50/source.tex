    \incorrect
    
    $f(x) = \fx$ is decreasing at $x=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$
    
    
    \reason
    
    This is a trick question. For $f'(x)$ to be defined, $f(x)$ must also be defined 
    at that point. But $f(x)$ is not defined at $x=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$\newline 
    
    Here is why \newline 
    
    $f(x) = \log \left(\tan\frac{x}{2} \right)$. Hence, $\tan\frac{x}{2} > 0$ for $f(x)$ to be defined \newline 
    
    But at $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}, \tan\frac{x}{2} = \tan\frac{3\pi}{4} < 0$\newline 
    
    Hence, $f(x)$ is not defined. And therefore, neither is $f'(x)$\newline 
    
    The question of $f(x)$ increasing or decreasing at $x=\frac{3\pi}{2}$ therefore does not arise
