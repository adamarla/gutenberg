    \[ \qquad \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + \left(\dydx \right)^3 + 6y^5 = 0 \]
    is a differential equation of degree $1$
    
    \reason
    
    To find the degree (or order) of a differential equation, one must look at 
    the \underline{most} differentiated term\newline 
    
    In this case, that is $\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ \newline 
    
    It is a second-order differential raised to the power of $1$\newline 
    
    Therefore, it's order is $2$ and \underline{degree} is $1$
