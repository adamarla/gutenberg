    \incorrect
    $f(x) = \sin x\cdot \cos x$ is not continuous at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ 
    
    \reason
    
    $\sin x$ is continuous for all $x$. So is $\cos x$\newline 
    
    And as the product of two continuous functions is also continuous, 
    therefore so is \[ \qquad f(x) = \sin x\cdot \cos x \]
