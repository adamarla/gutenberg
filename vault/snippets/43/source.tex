    At a given time $t$, the position of a particle is given by $(x,y) = \left(t, \log t \right)$\newline
    
    This particle is accelerating along the $x-$axis
    \reason
    
    The \underline{speed} of the particle \underline{along the $x-$axis} is given by \[\quad s_x = \frac{d}{dt} x = \frac{d}{dt} t = 1\]
    
    It's acceleration, however, is 
    \[ \quad a_x = \frac{d}{dt} s_x  = 0 \]
    
    Hence, the particle is \underline{not} accelerating along the $x-$axis. In fact, its speed (along $x-$axis) is constant
