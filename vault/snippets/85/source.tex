    The degree of the differential equation \[\left(1+\dydx \right)^3 = \left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \right)^2\text{ is } 3\] 
    \reason
    
    Both the order and the degree come from the \underline{highest order} differential
    term\newline 
    
    The highest order differential is $\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$. And as we have $\left(\dfrac{d^2 y}{dx^2} \right)^2$, the \underline{degree} is $2$
