    The following differential equation 
    \[ \qquad x^3 \expa + x\expb = 0 \]
    is of \underline{order 3 and degree 4}
    
    \reason
    
    $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ is the most $y$ has been differentiated with respect to $x$. Hence, the \underline{order} of the differential equation is $2$ \newline 
    
    The degree of the equation \underline{will also} come from this highest-order 
    differential term \newline 
    
    Notice that in $\expa, \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ has been raised to the power $2$. Hence, the \underline{degree} is also $2$ \newline 
    
    Every other term, like $\expb$, \underline{is irrelevant}
