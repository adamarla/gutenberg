    If it is cloudy in the morning, then the probability that it will rain in the afternoon is $0.6$. If it is not cloudy, then the probability of rain is $0.3$\newline 
    
    The probability of it being cloudy tomorrow morning is $0.4$. The probability 
    that it will rain tomorrow is therefore $0.38$

    If we define the following two events 
    \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{Nl}
   \toprule
        \text{Event} & Meaning  \\
   \midrule 
   C & Cloudy in the morning \\
    \midrule 
    R & Rain in the afternoon \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
then we have been told the following 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{NNl}
   \toprule
        &  \text{Value} & Meaning \\
   \midrule 
   \prob{C} & 0.4 & Cloudy tomorrow morning \\
    \midrule 
    \condp{R}{C} & 0.6 & Rain if cloudy \\
    \midrule 
    \condp{R}{C'} & 0.3 & Rain if not cloudy \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
    And we have to find $\prob{R}$ -- which is 
    \smallmath\begin{align}
	\prob{R} &= \underbrace{\condp{R}{C}\cdot\prob{C} + \condp{R}{C'}\cdot \prob{C'}}_{\text{Theorem of Total Probability}} \\[-10pt]
	&= 0.6\times 0,4 + 0.3\times \left(1-0.4 \right) \\
	&= 0.42 
\end{align}
