    \[ R = \left\lbrace (-10,3), (-7,3), (3,3), (11,3) \right\rbrace\]
    is a relation but not a function 
    \reason
    
    Each $x$ in each $(x,y)\in R$ maps to a single $y (=3)$. Hence, the given relation is a function. In fact, the given relation is a \underline{constant function} \newline 
    
    Note that this is different from the case where a single $x$ maps to multiple $y's$. In that case the relation would not have been a function
