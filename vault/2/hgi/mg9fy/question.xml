Suppose a girl throws a die. If she gets a $5$ 
or $6$, she tosses a coin $3$ times and notes the
number of heads. If she gets $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$,
she tosses a coin once and notes whether a 
head or a tail is obtained. If she obtained
exactly one head, what is the probability that 
she threw $1$, $2$, $3$ or $4$ with the die?

  <step>
    <context>%text
If $E_1$ is the event that she rolled $1$, $2$, $3$ or
$4$ and $E_2$ is the event that she rolled $5$ or $6$, 
and $H$ is the event that exactly one head was
obtained from the coin toss(es), what is the
question asking?
%
</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
Probability that given $H$ occured, it must have
followed $E_1$, or $P(E_1|H)$.
%
</tex>
    <tex>%text
Probability that given $E_1$ occured, $H$ will 
follow, or $P(H|E_1)$.
%
</tex>
    <reason>%text
The question is clearly asking us the probability
of the past event (the die roll) given the future
event that a single head was the result of coin
toss(es). Expressed symbolically as $P(E_1|H)$.

If $E_1$ is the event that she rolled $1$, $2$, $3$ or
$4$ and $E_2$ is the event that she rolled $5$ or $6$, 
what are $P(E_1)$ and $P(E_2)$?
%
</context>
    <tex>P(E_1)=\dfrac{2}{3}, P(E_2)=\dfrac{5}{6}</tex>
    <reason>%text
From the basic definition of probability, the
likelihood of events $E_1$ and $E_2$ are,
%
P(E_1)=\dfrac{4}{6}=\dfrac{2}{3} \\
P(E_2)=\dfrac{2}{6}=\dfrac{1}{3} \\
%text
Note that $P(E_1)+P(E_2)=1$, indicating the
two events are mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive in that between them they cover 
the entire sample space.
%</reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>%text
If $H$ be the event that there is exactly one
head at the end of the exercise, what is the
probability of $H$ succeeding $E_1$ $(P(H|E_1))$ 
and of $H$ succeeding $E_2$ $(P(H|E_2))$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>P(H|E_1)=\dfrac{1}{2}, P(H|E_2)=\dfrac{3}{8}</tex>
    <tex>P(H|E_1)=\dfrac{1}{2}, P(H|E_2)=\dfrac{1}{3}</tex>
    <reason>%text
Let us consider each case individually. After
$E_1$ she tosses a coin once, 
%
\therefore P(H|E_1)=\dfrac{1}{2} \\
%text
After $E_2$ she tosses a coin thrice which can
lead to $8$ possible total outcomes $(2^3)$. Of 
these, a single head can come from exactly
three configurations (HTT, THT and TTH),
%
\therefore P(H|E_2)=\dfrac{3}{8}
</reason>

We have established thus far that,
%
{\small P(E_1)=\dfrac{2}{3}, P(E_2)=\dfrac{1}{3},
  P(H|E_1)=\dfrac{1}{2}, P(H|E_2)=\dfrac{3}{8}} \\
%text
Given the above, what is $P(H)$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>P(H)=\dfrac{11}{24}</tex>
    <tex>P(H)=\dfrac{7}{8}</tex>
    <reason>%text
Since $E_1$ and $E_2$ are exhaustive events, 
by theorum of total probability,
%
\begin{align}
  P(H)&amp;=P(H|E_1)\cdot P(E_1)+P(H|E_2)\cdot P(E_2) \\
    &amp;=\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot \dfrac{2}{3}+\dfrac{3}{8}\cdot \dfrac{1}{3}
    =\dfrac{1}{3}+\dfrac{1}{8}=\dfrac{11}{24}

\end{align}
</reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>\text{If }P(H)=\dfrac{11}{24}, P(E_1)=\dfrac{2}{3} \text{ and } P(H|E_1)=\dfrac{1}{2}, \\
%text
what is $P(E_1|H)$?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>P(E_1|H)=\dfrac{8}{11}</tex>
    <tex>P(E_1|H)=\dfrac{3}{11}</tex>
    <reason>%text
Using Bayes' Theorum or the formula for 
conditional probability,
%
\begin{align}
  P(E_1|H)&amp;=\dfrac{P(H\cap E_1)}{P(H)} \\
    &amp;=\dfrac{P(E_1)\cdot P(H|E_1)}{P(H)} \\
    &amp;=\dfrac{\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{11}{24}}
    =\dfrac{8}{11}
\end{align} \\
%text
Note:${\small P(H)=P(E_1)\cdot P(H|E_1)+P(E_2)\cdot P(H|E_2)}$
had already been established in the previous 
step.
