Let $A=\{1,2,3\}$, $B=\{4,5,6,7\}$ and let
$f=\{(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)\}$ be a function from 
$A$ to $B$. State whether $f$ is one-one or not.

    <context>%text
Given $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{4,5,6,7\}$
consider these functions from $A$ to $B$:
$f=\{(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)\}$ 
$g=\{(1,4), (2,5), (3,4)\}$.
$h=\{(2,5), (3,6), (1,7)\}$.
Which of the following is true?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
$f$ and $h$ are one-one, 
$g$ is not one-one.
%</tex>
    <tex>%text
$f$ and $h$ are not one-one, 
$g$ is one-one.
%</tex>
    <reason>%text
A function is said to be{\bf one-one} only if
for each value in $A$ (in this case), there is
a unique corresponding value in $B$.
As can be seen, $g(1)=g(3)=4$ which makes
$g$ a{\bf many-one} instead of one-one.
