Show that the relation S in the set 
$A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$ given by 
$S=\{(a,b): a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, |a-b|$ is divisible by $4$\}
is an equivalence relation. Find the set of 
all elements related to 1.

Are the following pairs a valid examples of
$S=\{(a,b): a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, |a-b|$ is divisible by $4$\}
in the set $A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$?

    <tex>(1,5), (12,4), (6,8), (2, 6), (3,15)</tex>
    <reason>\begin{align}
  (1,5)&amp;=|1-5|=4 \\
  (12,4)&amp;=|12-4|=8 \\
  (5,11)&amp;=|5-11|=6 \\
  (2, 6)&amp;=|2-6|=4 \\
  (3,15)&amp;=|3-15|=12
\end{align} \\
%text
Of the above, $6$ is not divisible by $4$ and $15$
is not a member of set A. Therefore, all pairs 
above are valid examples of the relation S, 
with the exception of $(5,11)$ and $(3, 15)$.

What conditions must a relation satisfy for
it to be an equivalence relation?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
It must be reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

    <tex>%text
It must be reflexive, but not symmetric or 
transitive.

    <reason>%text
An equivalence relation must be reflexive, 
symmetric and transitive. Next, what are
these and how do we go about proving
them?

Is the relation
$S=\{(a,b): a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, |a-b|$ is divisible by $4$\}
in the set $A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$ reflexive? 
In other words, does $(a, a)\in A$ and is $|a-a|$ 
divisible by $4$?
%
</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
Yes, $(a,a)$ is reflexive since $|a-a|$ is divisible 
by $4$.
%
</tex>
    <reason>%text
$|a-a|=0$ which is divisible by $4$, therefore 
relation $S$ is reflexive.

Is the relation
$S=\{(a,b): a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, |a-b|$ is divisible by $4$\}
in the set $A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$ symmetric? 
In other words, does $(a, b)=(b, a)$?
%
</context>
    <tex correct='true'>%text
Yes, $(a,b)=(b,a)$ therefore the relation is 
symmetric.
%</tex>
    <reason>%text
$(a,b)=|a-b|$ which is obviously equal to 
$|b-a|$, therefore if $(a,b)\in S$ is true then 
$(b,a) \in S$ is also true and the relation is 
symmetric.

Is the relation
$S=\{(a,b): a, b\in \mathbb{Z}, |a-b|$ is divisible by $4$\}
in the set $A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$ transitive? 
In other words, if $(a, b)\in S$ and $(b,c)\in S$, 
does it mean $(a,c)\in S$ is also true?
%
</context>
    <tex>%text
If $(a,b)\in S$ and $(b,c)\in S$ we cannot presume
$(c,a)\in S$.
%</tex>
    <reason>\begin{align}
  (a,b) &amp;= |a-b| \\
  (b,c) &amp;= |b-c| \\
  (c,a) &amp;= |c-a| \\   
\end{align} \\
%text
If $|a-b|=4k$ and $|b-c|=4l$, then
$a=b\pm 4k$ and $c=b\pm 4l$. Therefore,
$|c-a|$ must be divisible by $4$.
Moreover, since $(a,b)\in A$, their difference
would also be $\in A$.
Therefore, $(a,b)$ is transitive.

For the relation S in the set 
$A=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}:0 \le x\le 12\}$ find the set of 
all elements related to 1. 
In other words, find the set of $(1, a)$ for 
which $|1-a|$ is divisible by $4$.
