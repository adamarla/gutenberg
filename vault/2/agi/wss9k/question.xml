    <tex>%text
A ladder $5$m long is leaning against a wall. 
The bottom of the ladder is pulled along the 
ground, away from the wall, at the rate of 
$2$cm/s. How fast is its height on the wall
decreasing when the foot of the ladder is $4$m 
away from the wall?

  <step>
    <context>%text
If $x$ is the distance of the foot of the ladder
from the wall, and $y$ is the distance of the
top of the ladder from the floor, what is the
relationship between $x$ and $y$?
%</context>
    <tex>x+y=c\text{ (some constant)}</tex>
    <reason>%text
$x$, the distance of the foot of the ladder from
the wall and $y$, the distance of the top of
the ladder from the floor, always form a right
triangle with the ladder itself such that,
%
x^2+y^2=l^2, \text{ where l=length of ladder (5m)}</reason>

If $x^2+y^2=5^2$ where $x$(m) is distance of
foot of the ladder from the wall and $y$(m) 
is the distance of the top of the ladder from
the floor. How is rate of change of $y$ with time
related with rate of change of $x$ with time?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>\dfrac{dy}{dt}=-\dfrac{x}{y}\dfrac{dx}{dt}</tex>
    <tex>\dfrac{dy}{dt}=-\dfrac{dx}{dt}</tex>
    <reason>%text
Rate of change of $y$ with time=$\left(\dfrac{dy}{dt}\right)$ 
Rate of change of $x$ with time=$\left(\dfrac{dx}{dt}\right)$,
%
\begin{align}
   &amp;x^2+y^2=5^2 \\
  \implies &amp;2x \dfrac{dx}{dt}+2y \dfrac{dy}{dt}=0 \\
  \implies &amp;\dfrac{dy}{dt}=-\dfrac{x}{y}\dfrac{dx}{dt}
    =  -\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{25-x^2}}\dfrac{dx}{dt}
\end{align}</reason>
  </step>
  <step>
    <context>%text
If $\dfrac{dy}{dt}=-\dfrac{x}{y}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$, what is $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$
when $x=4$m?
%</context>
    <tex correct='true'>\dfrac{8}{3}(cm/s)</tex>
    <tex>\dfrac{8}{3}(m/s)</tex>
    <reason>\begin{align}
  \dfrac{dy}{dt}&amp;=-\dfrac{x}{y}\dfrac{dx}{dt} \\
    &amp;=-\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{25-x^2}}\dfrac{dx}{dt} \\
    &amp;=-\dfrac{4}{\sqrt{25-16}}(0.02) \\
    &amp;=-\dfrac{4\times 0.02}{3}=-\dfrac{0.08}{3}(m/s)
