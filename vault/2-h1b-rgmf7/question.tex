% This is an empty shell file placed for you by the 'examiner' script.
% You can now fill in the TeX for your question here.

% Now, down to brasstacks. ** Writing good solutions is an Art **. 
% Eventually, you will find your own style. But here are some thoughts 
% to get you started: 
%
%   1. Write the solution as if you are writing it for your favorite
%      14-17 year old to help him/her understand. Could be your nephew, 
%      your niece, a cousin perhaps or probably even you when you 
%      were that age. Just write for them.
%
%   2. Use margin-notes to "talk" to students about the critical insights
%      in the question. The tone can be - in fact, should be - informal
%
%   3. Don't shy away from creating margin-figures you think will help
%      students understand. Yes, it is a little more work per question. 
%      But the question & solution will be written only once. Make that
%      attempt at writing a solution count.
%
%   4. At the same time, do not be too verbose. A long solution can
%      - at first sight - make the student think, "God, that is a lot to know".
%      Our aim is not to scare students. Rather, our aim should be to 
%      create many "Aha!" moments everyday in classrooms around the world
% 
%   5. Ensure that there are *no spelling mistakes anywhere*. We are an 
%      education company. Bad spellings suggest that we ourselves 
%      don't have any education. Also, use American spellings by default
% 
%   6. If a question has multiple parts, then first delete lines 40-41
%   7. If a question does not have parts, then first delete lines 43-69

\begin{parts}
	\part[2] Find the area of $R$.
\insertQR{QRC}
\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
   The two curves intersect at points where,
   \begin{align}
       y = 2x &= x^2 \\
       \Rightarrow x\cdot(x-2) &= 0 \text{ or } x = 0,2
   \end{align}
   The required area - $R$ - is therefore, 
   \begin{align}
      R &= \int_0^2 2x\ud x - \int_0^2 x^2\ud x \\
        &= \left[ 2\cdot\dfrac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^2 - \left[ \dfrac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 \\
        &= 4 - \dfrac{8}{3} = \dfrac{4}{3}
   \end{align}
		
\end{solution}

	\part[2] The region $R$ is the base of a solid. For this solid, at each $x$ the cross section perpendicular to the x-axis has an area $A(x)=\sin{\dfrac{\pi}{2}x}$. Find the volume of the solid.
\insertQR{QRC}
\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	    Let Volume of the solid be $V$.
	    \begin{align}
	    		\text{V} &= \int \sin \left(\dfrac{\pi}{2}x\right)\ud x							\\
	    				 &= \left[\dfrac{- \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}x\right)}
	    				 	{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right]_0^2	\\
	    				 &= \left(-\dfrac{2}{\pi}\cos \pi + \dfrac{2}{\pi}\cos 0\right)			\\
	    				 &= \dfrac{4}{\pi}
	    \end{align}
	\end{solution}
	
	\part[2] Another solid has the same base $R$. For this solid, the cross sections perpendicular to the y-axis are squares. Write. but do not evaluate, an integral expression for the volume of the solid.
\insertQR{QRC}
\begin{solution}[\mcq]
	Cross-sections are squares means height of the solid is equal to the base for any given cross-section. Further, since the areas are perpendicular to the $y$-axis, the integral for Volume $V$ would be with respect to an infinitesimal width of $\ud y$
		\begin{align}
				\text{V} = \int_0^2 \left(\frac{y}{2} - \sqrt{y}\right)^2\ud y
		\end{align}
	\end{solution}
\end{parts}
